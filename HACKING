Hacking vlc
===========

You will need the following tools if you plan to use the CVS version of vlc:

 - autoconf version 2.50 or later
 - automake version 1.6 or later
 - gettext version 0.10.4 or later

After retrieving the CVS tree, you need to run the bootstrap script to
generate all the files needed to build vlc. You can then run configure.

If you do not have the correct version of these tools, or if they are
simply not available for the operating system you plan to develop on,
you can check out a CVS tree on an OS that provides these tools (such
as a recent Linux distribution), run bootstrap, and then copy the whole
tree to your retarded OS.
