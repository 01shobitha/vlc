ChangeLog for vlc
=================

0.2.70:

  * Fixed headers for FreeBSD compilation.
  * Fixed debian/rules for non-x86 packages (Closes: Debian bug #88583).
  * Deleted BBitmap[0] directly after overlay creation as no longer needed
    as overlay now owns Bits()
  * Fixed MPEG-1 mux_rate parsing.
  * Fixed MPEG-1 stuffing.
  * Don't create BBitmap drawing thread if using overlays
  * Changes to BeOS interface with file selection support
  * Fixed a boolean_t/int mix.
  * Increased FIFO_SIZE.
  * Fixed all alignment issues
  * Networked TS input
  * Working menus for run-time audio/spu/title/chapter selection with gtk
    interface.
  * Port of the interface menus to gnome plugin.
  * Gtk playlist
  * Tried to fix the "stream jumps at will" bug.
  * Fixed most of the bugs in gnome interface menus
  * Added radio checks in menu items.
  * Bug fixes and enhancements in the Gtk+/Gnome interfaces.
  * Borrowed config.guess and config.sub from SDL [MacOS X port] ;
  * Changed files so that the MacOS X port compiles & runs [MacOS X port] ;
  * If SDL/GTK/DSP is not available, don't compile the associated module.
  * Gtk+ interface: fixed a precision issue in the scale.
  * Qt interface: somebody pop up us the menu!!
  * Fixed Debian sparc build for real (Closes: Debian bug #89285).
  * vlc core compiles under QNX RTOS. Now if anyone feels like tidying
    it and writing output and interface plugins...
  * Split audio output into several separate files to make it easier
    to debug. Removed a few redundancies as well.
  * Support for Darwin CoreAudio, courtesy of Colin Delacroix [MacOS X port] ;
  * Added warnings for ac3 mantissa (we still have problems with AC3 on
    MacOS X) ;
  * Renamed WriteResource to avoid a namespace clash with Darwin's
    WriteResource.
  * Compile Darwin module by default on Darwin system. [MacOS X port]
  * Use $QTDIR for the qt module ;
  * SDL fixes and enhancements by Shane Harper <shanegh@optusnet.com.au>
  * Header cleaning: filled all empty authors fields, added CVS $Id stuff.
  * Fixes to aout_darwin.c by Colin Delacroix <colin@zoy.org>.
  * Fixes to configure.in, Makefile.in and main.c (Altivec detection)
    by Eugenio Jarosiewicz <ej0@cise.ufl.edu>.   
  * Added a SYNCHRO_START in DVDRead for each cell change to fix
    multi-angle streams
  * Changed seek function to prevent jump-at-will and to remove two bugs in
    sector computing.
  * Initialize some values in netlist (payload_discard wasn't which caused
    frame dropping)
  * Come back of multi-sector read which should make reading faster
  * Language & Inteface support for BeOS interface
  * XVideo plugin courtesy of Shane Harper <shanegh@optusnet.com.au>
  * Makefile.in and configure.in fixes by Nilmoni Deb <ndeb@ece.cmu.edu>
  * A few syntax fixes in the plain X11 plugin
  * Various bug fixes in dvd_netlist. Some bugs seem to remain though.
  * New function input_ToggleES for interaction with interface.
  * Changes in gnome interface : navigation menus are now splited, there
    are radio item in menus and the code should be better.
  * First step for dvd_ifo rewritting. Now allocation/disallocation is
    being done as it has to be.
  * Fixed a bug in title management that make dvd like Seven work.
  * vout_beos now uses double buffering for YCbCr overlay.
    This (for some reason) improves audio/video sync
  * Fixes for the Qt plugin compilation under Debian
  * Heavy butchering in the CSS and DVD ioctl code to put all architecture-
    dependent code in dvd_ioctl.c
  * Added almost fully-functional /dev/dvd driver for MacOS X in
    extras/DVDioctl.
  * Fall back to one-packet-once reading in dvd input since multi-block
    seems to have a bug that make the vlc crash on title/audio/spu change. I
    hope that this bug will be fixed soon for the performance is poorer now
  * Add-ons and changes in gnome interface:
    o menu subdivision is done only if there are over 20 items,
    o in DVD mode next/prev apply to title,
    o in DVD mode, added a box with button to navigate through chapters.
  * Additional enhancements to the OS X DVD ioctl module
  * Big cleaning of the BeOS DVD ioctl code, got rid of all Linuxisms
  * Compilation fixes for the BeOS DVD ioctls
  * XVideo plugin enhancements by Shane Harper <shanegh@optusnet.com.au>
  * Added the GNU getopt library, which gets compiled in when getopt_long
    isn't available on the desired platform.
  * Replaced the `--warning' flag with the standard cumulative `-v' flag.
    `-v' is like `--warning 3', and `-vvvv' is like `--warning 0'
    (`--warning' is still valid for those used to it)
  * Cleaning in configure.in and Makefile.in, the Solaris port now
    builds and runs properly.
  * Code cleanup: removed a few tabulations.
  * Fixed inline asm routines to remove all read/write operands.
  * Added <string.h> to most files to prevent warnings under FreeBSD.
  * Added "break;" after "default:" in case switches to prevent
    warnings when compiling with GCC 3.0pre.
  * Sync MOSX dev/CVS tree : code support for MacOS X audio, video and
    interface (courtesy of Eugenio Jarosiewicz & Colin Delacroix) ;
  * Cleaning code and a small fix to make quit work on OSX
  * Disable x11 plugin if X11 headers are not found.
  * Misc fixes in the DVD input.
  * Fixed CSS authentication under Linux.
  * Playlist now refreshes when a file is opened.
