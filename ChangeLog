# ChangeLog for vlc #
#===================#

HEAD

  * Added support in ./configure for the cprof profiler.
  * Activated -D_FILE_OFFSET_BITS=64 -D__USE_UNIX98 on all platforms, fixes
    issues under Solaris and QNX.
  * Additional checks for SSE-specific (non-MMXEXT) instructions, as
    reported in lucky.openbsd.misc.
  * GNU/Hurd configuration and compilation fixes.
  * Fixed a crash in subtitle rendering.
  * Activated old crappy subtitle rendering in overlay mode (ugly but
    probably better than having no subtitles at all).
  * Added proper Conflicts: rules in debian/control.
  * configure.in fixes for BSD/OS.
  * Added BSD/OS libdvd by Steven M. Schultz <sms@TO.GD-ES.COM> in
    extras/BSDI_dvdioctl after he suggested us to do so. License is GPL.
  * ./configure now checks for an installed libdvd under BSD/OS and
    falls back to ours if not found.
  * Fixed harmless typos in yesterday's Solaris libdvd patches.
  * Bumped libdvdcss version number up to 0.0.3.
  * Added vlc:loop playlist command to go back at the beginning.
    Usage: vlc file1.mpeg file2.mpeg ... fileN.mpeg vlc:loop
  * Fixed a bug in the gtk interface which caused vlc to go amok after
    having met a zero-sized area.
  * 'snapshot*' rules do not depend on 'clean', and don't use /tmp anymore.
  * Solaris DVD decryption support by Håkan Hjort <d95hjort@dtek.chalmers.se>.

0.2.82
Tue,  7 Aug 2001 12:39:16 +0200

  * Got Makefile to launch ./configure almost properly. $(MAKECMDGOALS) rules !
  * Various debian scripts fixes.
  * Added -lmsvcrt40 to the win32 flags for proper execution under Wine.
  * Fixed broken soname setting under Solaris (and OS X, sort of).
  * Made the illegal instruction report more explicit.
  * BSD/OS 4.3beta1 fixes by Steven M. Schultz <sms@TO.GD-ES.COM>.
  * Fixed the sdl video output plugin that was broken 2 days ago.
  * libdvdcss* packages are now a bit more policy-compliant.
  * Tidied the snapshot-* Makefile rules.
  * Tidied the modules Makefiles.
  * Removed useless stuff in the debian/ directory.
  * Removed the "make all" kludge in the Makefile.opts rule. I hope this
    patch is harmless on all systems.
  * Added a dummy libdvdcss so that the DVD plugin can be used without
    libdvdcss. It will try to dlopen() libdvdcss at runtime, though,
    and will use the dummy functions only if it couldn't find a valid
    libdvdcss. This is probably only useful to package maintainers.
  * Made the remote command plugin usable even with no stream.
  * Fixed a deadlock in the remote command plugin.  
  * Fixed a deadlock in the SPU decoder.
  * Minor bug fix to aout_directx.c.
  * Big rewrite of the DirectX audio plugin. The audio output is now (almost)
    perfect on Win32.
  * Fixed a bug in ac3dec_CreateThread() in ac3_decoder_thread.
  * On Win32, open() will now open files in binary mode by default.
  * A few minor changes to vout_xvideo.c.
  * Fixed a segfault in yuv_End() in video_yuvmmx.c.
  * Fixed the "Gdk-ERROR **: BadCursor" bug in the x11 and xvideo plugins.
  * Fixed a segfault in SetBufferPicture() in video_output.c.
  * Fixed a segfault in PSEnd in input_ps.c.
  * The video decoder thread is now also reniced to a lower priority on
    Win32 (like in the Linux version). This slightly increases the
    responsiveness of vlc.
  * Fixed a Win32 bug in libdvdcss. This bug was appearing on title change.
  * Modified input_dvd so you can now go directly to the selected chapter
    when you change the title.
  * Implemented the Probe function in the Xvideo plugin. Xvideo is now the
    default video output plugin when it is supported. 
  * Now use SDL_CFLAGS for searching SDL/SDL.h.
  * Don't miserably die in `make` when ./configure hasn't be run.
  * Fixed a bug when compiling KDE plug-in without Qt plug-in.
  * Now taking into account $KDEDIR.
  * Made SDL configure error messages more explicit.
  * --disable-sdl is now correctly taken into account.
  * Changed the order of evaluation of sdl-config and sdl11-config.
  * Finally fixed SDL*/SDL.h check.
  * VC++/Intel compiler fixes by Jon Lech Johansen <jon-vl@nanocrew.net>.
  * Better gtk-config detection.
  * Removed duplicate checks in configure.in.
  * Fixed a typo in vlc.spec.

0.2.81
Sat, 28 Jul 2001 04:13:57 +0200

  * Fix in libdvdcss in the key caching code.
  * Removed useless variables in configure.in which caused all subsequent
    compilation tests to fail.
  * Additional fixes to the sdl-config detection.
  * Added a make uninstall rule.
  * Changed libdvdcss API to force binary incompatibility. Yeah, this is
    evil, but if we don't do it now we'll have to do it when more people
    are using it.
  * Fixed minor libdvdcss stuff such as the soname and compilation flags.
  * New --with-dvdcss flag.
  * Fixed a bug in aout spdif with dolby stereo (use of obsolete PTS).
  * Format asm functions for gcc, fixed the segfaults with imdct_sse.
  * Now using gcc -pipe.
  * (Hopefully) fixed the #@!$ field pictures bug.
  * Fixed the MMX YUV plugin issues with gcc 2.96 and 3.0.
  * Updated TODO, cosmetic changes.
  * Now use sdl-config for SDL.
  * Fixed a stupid bug in buffer management with field pictures.
  * Fixed a reinit bug after a discontinuity - such as seek().
  * The spdif audio output won't kill itself anymore at the beginning.
  * dvdcss_readv() optimisations for Win32.
  * Fixed _win32_dvdcss_aread() to work around the WinASPI32 64kb transfer
    size restriction.
  * New and theoretically better Win32 pthread implementation.
  * dvd_ifo.c now takes into account error messages from UDFFindFile.
  * Fixed the "quit" event handling in directx/vout_events.c.
  * Temporarily disabled aout_Probe() in aout_SDL (libSDL bug).
  * ncurses compilation fix by Michael Mondragon <mammon@lokmail.net>.
  * Fix for large inline functions and gcc 3.0.
  * Fixed the gnome plugin so that it does not include gtk headers.
  * libdvdcss segfault fixes.
  * Tuned constants, since it seems to make people happy.
  * Fixed the "paused movie won't restart" bug.
  * Removed the outdated generic decoder.
  * Rewrote the video decoder so that it can use multiple processors (--smp).
  * Fixed a bug in the video decoder initialization.
  * Grayscale mode now turns off chroma IDCT decoding.
  * Kludged so that times displayed in the scrollbar are finally correct
    for MPEG-2 streams.
  * FreeBSD compilation fix by Øyvind Kolbu <oyvindk@world-online.no>.
  * QNX RTOS plug-in by Jon Lech Johansen <jon-vl@nanocrew.net>.
  * Added IDEALX developer documentation in doc/.
  * Reactivated SDL parachute in non-debug mode (memory leak otherwise).
  * Fixed GetChunk for chunks < 4 bytes.
  * The Win98 DVD input is finally working.
  * Fixed 2 Win32 bugs in libdvdcss (in _win32_dvdcss_readv), one of them
    should have prevented the Win9x dvd input from working.
  * Moved the "if(Win2k)" out of the loop in _win32_dvdcss_readv.
  * Put a readv() function in input_iovec.h, the input_es plugin now compiles
    (Win32).
  * Modified input_ts to use readv() in input_iovec.h (Win32).
  * Fixed an initialisation bug in vout_directx.c.
  * Right clicking on the mouse displays the navigation menu (DirectX plugin).
  * Fixed audio/video synchro bug with esd, should fix buggy sound due
    to 44100-48000 Hz conversions.
  * The Win32 GetMessage function has been isolated in a thread. This has
    been done because this function can block the thread. Thanks to this
    change, you can now move your window without any video and audio
    interruption.
  * libdvdcss enhancements by Billy Biggs <vektor@dumbterm.net>. This breaks
    vlc's DVD input (looks like decoders are expecting data too early and
    DVD input can't cope with it due to decryption). Needs to be investigated.
  * Plugins are now compiled in plugins/* and libraries in lib/*.
  * The KDE UI compiles again but does not work yet.
  * ALSA plugin message corrections.
  * Calculation modules can now be calledwith a shorter name
    (eg. '--downmix mmx' instead of '--downmix downmixmmx').
  * Fixed insane verbosity of the SDL plugin.
  * Fixed the segfault in vout_UnloadFont.
  * The Xvideo plugin now closes the video window when it XVideoGetPort
    fails in vout_Create.
  * Fixed alignement in imdct asm functions.
  * 16 byte alignement for data (needed for SSE).
  * Optimization in SSE downmix.
  * Removed unnecessary translations in the win32 code from block offsets to
    byte offsets. This was overflowing some variables.
  * Reduced the complexity of the Win9x ASPI functions because we only need
    to handle DVD drive access.
  * Win32 code now handles seeking in areas above 2.1 Go on DVDs.
  * Probably fixed the "X eats more and more CPU" bug. Please test.
  * mingw32 cross-compilation issue fixed.
  * Small optimization in vpar_blocks.c, sparing a few memset() calls.
  * Additional error checking in vout_sdl.c.
  * Minor manpage fix, conforming to Debian policy version 3.5.5.0
    (Closes Debian bug #99561).
  * Portablility fix: We now control the name to be used in the assembler
    code for a C function or variable.
  * Reenabled all the accelerated modules on Win32.
  * Bugfix for chapters change in DVD.
  * A few bug fixes for the directx plugin.
  * Removed the custom usleep function for win32 as we don't really need
    this accuracy, and it was eating cpu resources.
  * Elementary Stream input plugin (use it with --input es). Only works with
    video streams at the moment.
  * Added command line option '--stdout <filename>' which redirects stdout
    and stderr to the specified file. This option should mainly be useful
    on Win32.
  * On Win32, vlc now has an icon associated to the .exe file, and is a full
    GUI application (you don't have this annoying dos command box anymore)
  * Added INSTALL-win32.txt for specific details to the Win32 port.
  * Compile fix for newer versions of MacOS X by Colin Simmonds
    <colin_simmonds@Mac.lover.org>.
  * Additional MacOS X DVD ioctl work by Eugenio Jarosiewicz
    <ej0@cise.ufl.edu>.
  * Win32 network support by Boris Dorès <babal@via.ecp.fr>.
  * Fixed an alignment issue in the ifo parser. The Matrix problem should
    be solved.
  * Minor cosmetic fixes and warning removals here and there.
  * FreeBSD (and probably QNX) shared memory handling fix.
  * First libdvdcss version (0.0.1).
  * Unrolled two loops in dvd_netlist.c to prevent message flooding.
  * DVD input stuttering fix by Jon Lech Johansen.
  * Removed a lock that caused late frames in DVDRead.
  * Added gprof profiling support with --enable-profiling.
  * Fully working Windows DVD ioctl support by Jon Lech Johansen.
  * DirectX enhancements by Gildas Bazin, such as software rendering.
  * Merged dvdcss_init and dvdcss_open into dvdcss_open, and dvdcss_close
    and dvdcss_end into dvdcss_close. libdvdcss API now has 7 functions.
  * Another failed attempt at profiling vlc under Linux: ported the
    threads API to GNU Pth. Activate with --enable-pth. It doesn't seem to
    spawn new threads for me, maybe someone will have better luck.
  * Makefile optimizations.
  * Automatic build of libdvdcss if not found.
  * The DVD netlist no longer stops when the fifo is empty ; it just waits
    until there are free vectors again.
  * Exported the CSS part of the dvd plugin into a library.
  * Slight modification in input_dvd since Getiovec wasn't at the right place.
  * Send escape packet when changing title, not to be stuck in some decoder.
  * The position in the title is now reset when we change title to
    prevent a title from being unavailable because we're stuck at the end.
  * Fixed a bug with 1-chapter-long titles that displayed chapter 0.
  * Added a _temporary_ field in p_main to know whether the audio stream is
    AC3 (ugly). It allows a vlc launched in spdif mode to play mpeg or lpcm
    audio.
  * Cleaned the title property messages to get rid of the ugly stars.
  * Added LPCM support. It should work with stereo LPCM.
  * Fixed a warning when compiling main.c.
  * Checked that OS supports SSE instructions on PIIIs (to avoid illegal
    hardware instructions on Linux 2.2.x).
  * Fixed a bug in synchro reinitialization: we no longer have a shift each
    time we restart the synchro (for SCR discontinuity for instance)
  * In DVD mode, we reinit the synchro only if the SCR are not continuous
    (instead of each cell).
  * Tried to improve AC3 spdif to prevent desynchronization.
  * Lots of DirectX plugin fixes by Gildas Bazin.   
  * Compilation fix in message queue mode.
  * Another FreeBSD compilation fix.
  * SDL compilation fix for FreeBSD.
  * Fixed compilation of motion modules as plugins.
  * Applied old FreeBSD patch for dvd input by German Tischler.
  * Found what was causing the slowdowns: a namespace collision. Put all
    plugins into builtins again.
  * Put most builtins in plugins again due to performances issues.
  * Fixed the painfully slow build process (at last!).
  * Added new dummy input plugin.

    the patches to the Gtk+ interface.
  * Fixed a segfault in the SPU decoder initialization.
  * Mandatory step for video output IV and the audio output quality
    fix: the output threads are now spawned when a decoder needs one,
    so it can decide the audio frequency or the video window size.

  * Come back of multi-sector read which should make reading faster
  * Language & Inteface support for BeOS interface
  * XVideo plugin courtesy of Shane Harper <shanegh@optusnet.com.au>
  * Makefile.in and configure.in fixes by Nilmoni Deb <ndeb@ece.cmu.edu>
  * A few syntax fixes in the plain X11 plugin
  * Various bug fixes in dvd_netlist. Some bugs seem to remain though.
  * New function input_ToggleES for interaction with interface.
  * Changes in gnome interface : navigation menus are now splited, there
    are radio item in menus and the code should be better.
  * First step for dvd_ifo rewritting. Now allocation/disallocation is
    being done as it has to be.
  * Fixed a bug in title management that make dvd like Seven work.
  * vout_beos now uses double buffering for YCbCr overlay.
    This (for some reason) improves audio/video sync
  * Fixes for the Qt plugin compilation under Debian
  * Heavy butchering in the CSS and DVD ioctl code to put all architecture-
    dependent code in dvd_ioctl.c
  * Added almost fully-functional /dev/dvd driver for MacOS X in
    extras/DVDioctl.
  * Fall back to one-packet-once reading in dvd input since multi-block
    seems to have a bug that make the vlc crash on title/audio/spu change. I
    hope that this bug will be fixed soon for the performance is poorer now
  * Add-ons and changes in gnome interface:
    o menu subdivision is done only if there are over 20 items,
    o in DVD mode next/prev apply to title,
    o in DVD mode, added a box with button to navigate through chapters.
  * Additional enhancements to the OS X DVD ioctl module
  * Big cleaning of the BeOS DVD ioctl code, got rid of all Linuxisms
  * Compilation fixes for the BeOS DVD ioctls
  * XVideo plugin enhancements by Shane Harper <shanegh@optusnet.com.au>
  * Added the GNU getopt library, which gets compiled in when getopt_long
    isn't available on the desired platform.
  * Replaced the `--warning' flag with the standard cumulative `-v' flag.
    `-v' is like `--warning 3', and `-vvvv' is like `--warning 0'
    (`--warning' is still valid for those used to it)
  * Cleaning in configure.in and Makefile.in, the Solaris port now
    builds and runs properly.
  * Code cleanup: removed a few tabulations.
  * Fixed inline asm routines to remove all read/write operands.
  * Added <string.h> to most files to prevent warnings under FreeBSD.
  * Added "break;" after "default:" in case switches to prevent
    warnings when compiling with GCC 3.0pre.
  * Sync MOSX dev/CVS tree : code support for MacOS X audio, video and
    interface (courtesy of Eugenio Jarosiewicz & Colin Delacroix) ;
  * Cleaning code and a small fix to make quit work on OSX
  * Disable x11 plugin if X11 headers are not found.
  * Misc fixes in the DVD input.
  * Fixed CSS authentication under Linux.
  * Playlist now refreshes when a file is opened.
  * XVideo plugin background is now black instead of white.

0.2.63
Mon,  5 Mar 2001 00:41:16 +0100

  * Got rid of the CONTRIBUTORS list, and switched AUTHORS to a
    linux-kernel like author list.
  * Updated TODO list.
  * Fixed a segfault in the BeOS interface when --noaudio was specified.
  * Title and Chapter selection in the Gnome and Gtk+ interfaces.
  * Fixed a bug in audio selection
  * Tried to fix an issue in size computing.
  * Commited BeOS changes by Richard Shepherd and Tony Castley.
  * Added boolean_t b_YCbr to vout_thread_s structure to flag YUV-YCbCr
    decoding needed instead of YUV-RGB
  * Will be removed later when video_output.c rewritten
  * vout_CreateThread() initialises b_YCbr to zero
  * New BeOS video plugin that supports hardware overlays and new
    MediaPlayer compatible interface
  * Added YUV-YCbCr transforms
  * Fixed bugs in title/chapter handling once more, especially for size
    detection and location of main movie.
  * Support for multitrack DVD : now the stream is given to input as it has
    to be ; however, all the tracks are displayed one after the other ; I
    think we need to decode navigation ES to choose the track
  * Fixed behaviour at end of device.
  * Added DVD/VCD button and menu for quick DVD device selection to the
    Gnome and Gtk+ interfaces, so that vlc can play a DVD even when
    launched from a GUI.
  * Added debian/* files to help generating CSS-enabled non-US packages,
    and changed plugins/dvd/* to reflect this change.
  * Added .xpm icons (fixes lintian warnings).
  * --help output and manpage are now in sync (Closes Debian bug #87478).
  * Fixed Build-dpends entry in debian/control (Closes Debian bug #83707).
  * Completely changed title and chapter initialization. Now we have real
    title units.
  * Fixed size for a majority of DVD.
  * More consistency in the p_input->stream management. 
  * Made input_SelectES() and input_UnselectES() not block the input thread
    for a long time.
  * Changed debian/control to fix Debian bug #83707
  * Added a --disable-css configure option
  * Moved some code here and there in the DVD plugin to make it easier
    for me to build the Debian CSS-free packages.
  * Fixed miscellaneous alignment problems (alpha/sparc ports) ;
  * Added a fps display when toggling 'i' ;
  * Fixed a bug in the video parser where one picture buffer was not
    released at quit time ;
  * Broke the mux_rate calculation, but hey guys ! it was already broken and
    nobody noticed it.
  * New function for DVD reading, that is able to read multiple blocks
    (I've chosen 32 now), that doesn't use any memcpy anymore and is also much
    faster. It is ready now for cell positioning in multi-angle DVD (to come  
    soon).
  * DVD specific netlist adapted to 2048 bytes long blocks that contain
    several data_packets.
  * Modification in mpeg_system.c to use p_payload_start instead of
    p_buffer (necessary for DVD plugin). It does not break other plugins
    since they set p_payload_start to p_buffer
  * New field i_read_once in input_thread_s to be able to read more than
    the TS related 7 packets ; i_read_once is set to INPUT_READ_ONCE by
    defaults but plugins can change it during initialisation.
  * Bug fix with frequential downmix
  * Additional optimizations to the subtitle decoder
  * The GGI video output should now be faster. Also, right-mouse-clicking
    works in GGI mode as well.
  * Optimizations done to the SPU decoder. Now the RLE is expanded at
    decoding time, not rendering time. The main loop in vout_RenderSPU
    is now 20 lines long.
  * The Gtk+ interface is now built as a Debian package as well. The Gnome
    package depends on it because of the icon and menu entry.
  * Added an intf_WarnHexDump() function to do raw hexadecimal dumps of
    memory areas. For debugging purposes or for real men, as you wish.
  * Lots of tidying in dvd_ioctl.c, a few comments added.
  * Better error handling in the subpicture decoder.
  * Tidied video_spu.c. More to come later.
  * Fixed subtitle displaying. Will soon work in overlay mode as well.
  * Disabled slice-level resynchro since it's probably buggy.
  * Fixed a structural major bug in the macroblock structure management.
  * Added debug messages.
  * Fixed a compile problem in debug mode.
  * Added functions and hooks to display dates instead of off_t.
  * Added a 'd' keystroke to dump the stream contents (for debugging
    purposes).
  * New ES detection based on .ifo for DVD module. It might fail (I have
    found one DVD for which ifo seems false).
  * Title and chapter selection on the command line (see -t and -T options)
    It will allow to watch some DVD that went through menus by default.
  * Beginning of menus in gnome interface.
  * Fix bug in ac3dec for mono streams
  * BeOS: bew video output method, the vlc now uses BBitmap instead of
    BDirectWindow (better performances)
  * BeOS: added resizing
  * BeOS: added beta support for overlay
  * Added a plain Gtk+ port of the Gnome interface, for the gnome-impaired
    people. Gtk+ is now compiled by default, while Gnome isn't (you will
    have to add --enable-gnome when running configure)
  * Replaced -lcurses with -lncurses in configure.in.
  * Added DemuxPSI, DecodePAT and DecodePMT. Never tested which streams
    where PAT or PMT are splitted in more than one section.

0.2.62
Fri,  2 Mar 2001 17:32:24 +0100

  * DVD plugin is still non-functional when you don't have DVD ioctls,
    but at least it compiles under BeOS as well.
  * Minor cosmetic changes here and there.
  * Added the BeOS code for vlc_mutex_destroy() and vlc_cond_destroy()
  * Minor optimizations in the video decoder.
  * Move ac3 globals variables into structures
  * Fixed a bash-ism in configure.in
  * Fixed a segfault in input.c when no input plugin was found for
    a given file.
  * Fixed a deadlock in the Gnome interface. Next time I'll initialize
    my mutexes, I promise.
  * Added Oct to the authors list in intf_gnome.glade :)
  * Second step in area management ; everything is in place now to have
    title handling; it is coming :)
  * Ported Glide and MGA plugins to the new module API. MGA never worked,
    so this didn't make it work better.
  * Started thinking about built-in modules, and added some code to
    make it easier eventually.
  * Added Oct in the AUTHORS file.
  * Fixed a mistake in configure.in.   
  * All your base are belong to us.
  * Fixed a bug in src/misc/modules which prevented loading modules
    when launched from the Tracker.
  * Fixed a similar bug in src/video_output/video_text.c.
  * BeOS CSS support, thanks to Markus Kuespert <ltlBeBoy@beosmail.com>
    who ported the Linux DVD ioctls. We can now read encrypted DVDs
    under BeOS ! Woohoo.
  * First serie of changes in DVD module for the forthcoming interface menus.
    There is a new capability in input type modules for setting the
    attributes of a new area. It is set to NULL for PS and TS plugins.
    It should be called for every title change, chapter change,
    audio mode change or spu channel change.
  * Kludge of the kludge, removing an oddity in YUV initialisation, and
    activating YUV overlay on startup whenever hardware acceleration is
    available. Thanks for bearing with us, stay tuned.
  * mux_rate parsing.
  * Changed video decoder's error messages into warnings.
  * Add dither fix
  * Drag and drop support under BeOS.
  * Change in the code to detect beginning of movie. It is much better now
    but still fails with some DVD for which the movie is not the first
    Program.
  * Beginning of ideas to handle chapters and ES selection
  * configure.in and Makefile.in patches for better SDL support and
    support for $(bindir) $(datadir) and $(libdir) stuff, courtesy
    of Arkadiusz Miskiewicz <misiek@pld.ORG.PL>
  * Ported ggi.so to the new modules API. As for the other modules, only
    the "q" key works. Moreover, VLC doesn't exit cleanly if you close the
    GGI window.
  * Deactivated non-working widgets in the Gnome interface.
  * Added CONTRIBUTORS file.
  * Ported the framebuffer plugin to the new module API. As for most of the
    other video output modules, keyboard doesn't work. Except ^C to quit.
  * UDF filesystem support so that we know the location of the first video
    related file with 100% reliability (great change that should make DVDs
    with binaries and extra stuff work with vlc).
  * Correction of a bug in ifo reading that falsified the adress of
    video titles.
  * Changed the method for selecting title at start. It is _not_ reliable
    though, but it is better than the preceding one.
  * Tried to fix the BeOS interface and video output. Any BeOS developers
    listening ? I can't even test that code, it probably wants additional
    fixing.
  * Added a workaround in modules.c for broken libc's which happen to truncate
    filenames in dentry structures when using 64bits offsets. The kind of
    stuff you only see in RedHats <g>.
  * Made the SDL error messages a bit more useful.
  * The Gnome menu is now created when mouse is released, not when it
    is pressed. It may sound stupid, but it really makes a difference.

0.2.61
Fri, 16 Feb 2001 08:09:59 +0100

  * Fixed package building (both RPMs and .debs).
  * Fixed `make snapshot' rule.
  * Added some magic to filename detection. To read a DVD you now just   
    need to run 'vlc dvd:/dev/hdc' for instance. Same for file:// URIs.
  * Fixed a segfault in the slider when no stream was playing.
  * Made the slider go from 0 to 100 (instead of 99 :)
  * The vlc now doesn't exit when finished playing. As a side effect of
    the playlist code being very recent, it continuously loops.
  * Fixed a segfault in the input thread creation, as well as a possible
    deadlock. This happened mostly when opening non-existing files.
  * Created input_SetStatus to do input_SetRate's job. input_SetRate will
    be used to set an arbitrary rate, for people who want to read DVDs at
    1/2.71828 times the actual speed.
  * Stubs for the ncurses control interface. No working code yet, but the
    holes just need to be filled.
  * Improved X11 support. Still not as functional as before.
  * The output window now states the method name, so that people know whether
    they are using X11 or SDL.
  * The Gnome interface is now drag'n'drop aware, you can drop a file
    on it just like Xine does (or so I guess).
  * New more recent css authentication code.
  * Beginning of udf support (not in Makefile)
  * Removed useless includes in intf_gnome.c
  * Made the vout_sdl.c functions static 
  * Ported vout_x11.c to the modules API; code isn't very nice yet though
  * X11 output works again. It's just the output, but it works; I now need
    to clean the code and add event handling.
  * Should have fixed the dependency generater for some plugins.

0.2.60
Wed, 14 Feb 2001 08:33:46 +0100

  * Started porting the X11 vout (still disabled)
  * A few unnoticeable changes in the Gnome intf
  * Changes in the way stream size in DVD mode is calculated. It is no
    longer such an ugly kludge and is much more accurate.
  * Changes in DVDSeek so that the interface slider is in 0 when we are at
    the beginning of the strem.
  * Try to detect the beginning of the movie in the middle of the title. It
    works for most of the DVDs but will begin in the middle of the movie
    with some others.
  * Calculate only the first title key in css mode because it might take a
    long time with some title. The search stops now when we have a key once
    whereas it did stop only when we had it twice before. It should not
    cause problems.
  * Really fixed MC segfault bug.
  * Adaptation of DVD module to navigation slider. The seek has to be
    done on a multiple of 2048, and shopuld take care of the offset to the
    beginning of the stream. It works with most of my DVDs by fails to
    detect size of some streams.
  * Change of the order of call to ifo and css functions in input_dvd.c,
    because we can't read ifo files before authentification on some DVDs.
  * Changed location of some css tables.
  * We read ifo date and decrypt css keys for all titles now. It takes quite a
    long time to initialize with some DVDs (if you have 42 titles for
    instance). The key decryption might give a false value if the title is
    less than 10 Mb ; I'm working on that :)
  * Quick patch to avoid a segfault when arbitrarily seeking the stream.
  * Added --intf option to vlc
  * Started cleaning vout_sdl.c
  * The dummy plugin works again
  * Added a slider to the Gnome interface so that we can browse through streams
  * Removed enhancement because of an incompatibility with slow motion.
  * We can now seek at position 0 :p ;
  * Tried to enhance picture dating on timebase discontinuities.
  * Fixed pause bug.
  * Much cleaning in css code. It should work fine now.
  * Fixed my old stupid bug that disabled sound after having played the
    first playlist item.
  * Added `Prev' and `Next' buttons to the interface, with the beginning of
    a playlist window (still empty).
  * Added `Slow' and `Fast' buttons to the interface and popup menu.
  * Removed tests against i_rate and i_new_rate calculation from the
    plugins and hid this complexity into input_ext-intf.c 
  * The pure Gnome part of the Gnome interface has been rewritten from
    scratch, and the .glade file included as well. You can edit it by
    installing glade-gnome and doing `glade plugins/gnome/intf_gnome.glade',
    or directly by hand if you grok XML.
  * Files can now be loaded into vlc using the `Open' buttons. But for the
    moment you still have to launch vlc with at least one file, because it
    quits when the end of the playlist is reached.
  * Idle screen was disabled because it eats a lot of CPU and is mostly
    useless for the moment. And it gets activated when pause lasts for too
    long.
  * Plugins have completely disappeared, we now only use the new module API.
  * All intf and vout modules are now independant. So far, only the Gnome
    intf module and the SDL vout module have been ported. configure.in has
    been modified to reflect the changes (x11 and dummy aren't compiled by
    default anymore, while SDL and Gnome are).
  * Right-clicking on the SDL video output window brings the Gnome menu.
  * Pause, Play, Exit, About work from the menu or from the interface window.
  * The old SDL keys still work.
  * Fixed a bug in #define that prevented from using ioctls
  * Some functions to prepare ifo commands utilisation to move in the
    structures of DVDs
  * Change in configure to avoid compiling css functions on BSD.
  * Added comments to src/interface/intf_plst.c and include/intf_plst.h
    so that people understand how the playlist works.
  * Updated the TODO list (34 items to do, 41 done !)
  * Portability : changed off64_t to off_t and activated appropriate
    GNU/Linux options ;
  * Changed fseek() to fseeko() for 64-bit offsets ;
  * Reset frame predictors on a stream discontinuity.
  * Implemented basic stream navigation function, and bound Jump forward
    and jump Backward in the SDL intf. Enjoy !
  * Pause function implemented ('p' key).
  * Fixed a compile probleme on machine without a dvd player :ppppp
  * Fixed two bugs in ifo and css that caused memory corruption and
    segfault when using sdl in dvd mode.
  * Moved the playlist handling from input/input.c to interface/interface.c
  * Fixed a few warnings at compile-time.
  * Fixed sound channel selection in playlist mode.
  * Added a color message in the plugin bank because on peut bien déconner
    cinq minutes, quand-même.
  * We now spawn a new input thread for each file.
  * Added a missing pf_close() because it's always cool to close files
    after we read them.
  * Solved bug with cssdescrambling. The vlc might segfault with dvd
    plugins. I will fix that soon. 
  * Minor modification in pluginification.
  * Playlist works again (still the old wrong way like Meuuh doesn't
    like, but this is going to change within a few hours)
  * Input_ps, input_ts and input_dvd are now plugins, located in
    plugins/mpeg/ and plugins/dvd/
  * Fast/slow keys are now A/Z instead of A/S since S was already
    linked to the scale/noscale toggle.
  * `--dvd' doesn't work anymore, for the moment try to use :
    vlc --input dvd /dev/dvd
  * Module bank is now less verbose ; use `--warn 1' to turn back
    verbosity on
  * New method using netlist to read packets on DVD device by sectors of
    2048 bytes.
  * Some modifications in netlist to make it work with DVD.
  * Fixed à bug in mpeg_system.c
  * We can now choose the speed of forward (between 32/1 and 1/8)
  * Functional fast forward and slow motion API ;
  * Dirty hack in the SDL intf to bind "a" (fAst forward), "s" (Slow motion)
    and "p" (Play).
  * Centralized clock management, preparing for stream navigation ;
  * Fixed a bug in the management of the first video PTS.
  * Fixed a bug in period calculation for progressive sequences.
  * Fixed a FIXME in SDL: p_vout->p_sys is no more used in intf_sdl.c
  * Used instead p_vout->i_changes like in x11
  * Disabled SDL parachute to let the vlc dump a core instead of staying stuck
  * Patched 2 debian bugs
    (see http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/pkgreport.cgi?pkg=vlc)
  * Improved the snapshot generation
  * Mouse pointer hidden/shown with middle button in SDL output
  * Removed obsolete video_yuv_mmx.S
  * Updated the TODO list and wrote a small todo.pl parser to make it
    easier to see which items remain to be done
  * `make snapshot' now creates vlc-*.tar.gz and vlc-*-nocss.tar.gz

0.2.50
Wed, 31 Jan 2001 04:30:37 +0100

  * Version 0.2.50 for the Linux Expo
  * --overlay and --fulscreen options (only work with --vout sdl)
  * The vlc exits after the end of the stream, which prevents from having
    to kill it and relaunch it during a presentation.
  * Not a very nice hack, but will probably spare us a few user complaints: if
    no -a option is specified, the vlc will play the first audio type it finds,
    so there is no need to specify "-a ac3" for a DVD anymore.
  * CSS support kludged for current DVD input.
    It is very slow now but will be more adapted to the forthcoming DVD
    input.
    It should read the first title of many DVDs but has been tested with few.
  * Beginning of ifo commands to implement DVD navigation.
  * Fix for field pictures.
  * Hooks for fast forward and slow motion support.
  * Fixed backwards moves.
  * Tuned up optimizations.
  * Completely removed BIZARRE_OPTIMS.
  * Check for the needed headers for DVD ioctls
  * Some cleaning in the dvd authentification code
  * Various miscellaneous minor optimizations of the video parser.
  * Beginning of support for encrypted DVDs.
  * It only tests encryption and authenticates disc.
  * Really fixed GetChunk now.
  * 32-bit aligned bitstream (not that fast).
  * The motion compensation routines are now modules as well ; choose your
    implementation with `--motion motion', `--motion motionmmx' or
    `--motion motionmmxext'. Of course, the best implementation is chosen
    if you don't ask for any. There doesn't seem to be any performance hit
    due to the move to shared libs, which is a good thing. Please test
    actively if you have time, though.
  * Updated --help result, manpage, INSTALL document, and a few files.
  * Borrowed LiViD's MMX and MMX EXT IDCT. This might break things. Expect
    a performance increase.
  * Removed a few useless malloc() and unused variables in the audio SDL stuff
  * Prepared the work for built-in modules (not yet finished)
  * Small tweak in the copy handling, reduce CPU usage.
  * --aout sdl now works
  * Added SDL sound support. Sounds a bit laggy sometimes but my streams
    are ill.  please try.
  * Modified configure.in and all that stuff. Re-run configure
  * SDL audio, video and interface are all part of the same .so now.
  * Removed YUV old files :->
  * Reverted something that wasn't supposed to go into the cvs :p
  * Removed -fargument-noalias-global which causes problems with as (???).
  * Borrowed livid's latest libmmx and MMXEXT MC. Not in the Makefile => to
    test it, replace vdec_motion_inner_mmx.c by vdec_motion_inner_mmxext.c.
  * A few changes in the CPU extensions detection code, borrowed from the
    kernel and from mpeg2dec. I still don't know how to detect if code
    compiled with -mcpu=pentiumpro will run, since the cpuid arcanes are
    quite obtuse to me. Perhaps we should also have a way not to load modules
    if they have been compiled with a different CPU to avoid segfaults.
  * Add check for MMX EXT extensions, which doesn't work, which is a good
    thing since there is no MMX EXT IDCT yet :)
  * Change for the forthcoming fast forward and slow motion support.
  * Fixed the --aout, --idct and --yuv flags
  * Updated manpage and --(long)help output to reflect that change
  * Removed a few unneeded #includes here and there
  * Cosmetic changes in error messages in input.c
  * Now use of 64 bits offsets to parse the whole DVD. So we have all the
    available information
  * Fixed a bug in parsing of VTS attributes
  * Fixed a bug in input.c that made input plugin initialize even though
    no stream is reachable (thanks Sam)   
  * Merged the YUV plugins in the same directory to avoid too much code
    duplication
  * YUV transformations now use the new module API ; now only the vout
    and interface still depend on the old plugin API
  * Changed TestMMX to TestCPU because we will be able to test for other
    specific extensions (3DNow, SSE) for the forthcoming IDCT we'll
    borrow to mpeg2dec (as usual :P)
  * Don't show "hiding module" messages anymore except in debug mode
  * Swapped C IDCT and Classic IDCT scores since the classic one seems
    to be faster ; anyway you should use the MMX one
  * Fixed a Makefile bug under BeOS
  * Tried to fix the cpuid code so that it compiles under BeOS (Polux, can
    you test it when you have time ?)
  * Fixed a bug in the frame rate handling ;
  * Fixed a bug in the DTS/PTS ordering. Our pts are _at last_ accurate.
  * Finally fixed repeat_first_field and co. (pas encore tout compris...)
  * Implemented video_parser bitstream callback for PTS/DTS.
  * Fixed close button support in SDL
  * Fixed --width and --height support in SDL
  * Fixed the bug-that-made-the-vlc-segfault-on-exit, which means that
    more than ever, « le client ne segfaulte pas ».
  * There was still a problem upon quitting: sometimes the null packet
    wasn't big enough to reach a decoder breakpoint, so I now create 10
    of them (since I can't make it bigger) to be sure. Meuuh, what do
    you think ?
  * Fixed the Makefile to spare a few variables here and there.
  * Reduced module hide delay, removed loading of the audio output
    plugins since they are now modules. 
  * Changed a few intf_Msg to intf_DbgMsg, and added "vout:", "intf:",
    and so on in a few other messages.
  * Removed unused includes in the idct modules.
  * Correction of bugs in ifo parsing. Now the structures should be well
    initialized. It remains some segfaults but it globally works.
  * DVD mode is enabled with option --dvd. For the moment, it only read
    the first vts and find the movie if it is at the beginning of the title
    set.
  * Beginning of dvd_input. Parsing of ifo file almost completed.
  * The IDCT functions are now located in modules : the classic IDCT,
    our optimized IDCT, and MMX IDCT.
  * Cosmetic changes for modules (pf_* instead of p_*)
  * Fixes to the BeOS and dummy modules 
  * Changed default values :
    INPUT_PTS_DELAY down to 200 ms ;
    video heap down from 10 to 5 pictures ;
    decoder fifo size from 1023 to 511 PES ;
  * Fixed various bugs in 32 bit-versions of input_ext-dec.h ;
  * Fixed a bug in GetChunk() ;
  * Renamed GetByte, GetWord, ShowWord to _GetByte, _GetWord, _ShowWord ;
  * Moved decoder_fifo-specific code from programs.c to dec.c ;
  * Fixed bugs in program.c that prevented vlc to close all decoders ;
  * Gave sam a lesson for the use of the bitstream in spu_decoder.c :ppp ;
  * Made the video parser unlock the reference pictures before quitting
    (still one left, yaknow why ?)
  * Destroy fifo mutex and cond variables _after_ they are used for
    the last time. henri, that'll be one binouze.
  * Attempt to port the BeOS audio plugin to the new module API. Will
    probably need a few fixes to work or even compile.
  * Ported the alsa plugin to the news vlc module API
  * Fixed 32 bits bitstream bugs.
  * Moved the MPEG audio decoder to the new bitstream
  * Cleaning in the SPU decoder.
  * Moved swab32 from input_ext-dec.h to common.h. We probably won't need
    it anymore really soon, since ntohl() and htonl() seem to be properly
    optimized when gcc is passed the right optimization flags.
  * Fixed GetBits32 and RemoveBits32. I know the #ifdefs are useless since
    we only support u32 words, but it's a safe reminder. Comments appreciated
    on this fix since I may have b0rked something -- it runs well here though.
  * Changed code for handling b_die in bitstream ;
  * Moved input_ext-dec.h to input.h ;
  * New input_NullPacket function ;
  * Fixed init bugs in input and vpar ;
  * Placed a callback to the decoder in the bitstream structure ;
  * Fixed a purify bug in input_ps.c ;
  * Added -mcpu=pentiumpro in the Makefile.
  * Complete commenting of modules_core.h and small modifications
  * Separated MODULE_CONFIG_START and ADD_WINDOW (Henri, beware)
  * Fixed a very, very old bug that caused namespace collision between
    plugins (Henri, beware: call your aout_getplugin function like this,
    not alsa_aout_getplugin)
  * Removed the Debian specific clean rules from the Makefile, since they
    are already handled by the debian/rules script.
  * Tidied a few compilation rules (-lfoo should always be at the end)
  * Added 8bits palette SDL support.
  * Fixed a warning under FreeBSD (dlerror() is a const char*, not a char*).
  * Made configure script look for the bswap assembly instruction (using
    AC_TRY_COMPILE makes sure the compiler will really accept it).
  * Fixed colors' bug (TODO: write a function in vout that recalculate colors
    from RGB masks);
  * Cleaning of the fullscreen switch, still sucks but the surface is not
    reallocated and that's good (thanks to the magic function
    SDL_WM_ToggleFullScreen provided by sdl library :).
  * Added a missing mutex_unlock in video_output.c
  * Moved a mutex_destroy after the thread cancellation to prevent
    possible problems
  * Added a missing #ifdef in intf_msg.c which prevented compilation
    with --enable-debug
  * Fixed a bug in the input that prevented to quit properly in certain
    cases (some ES were not deleted because their index was skipped when
    the former one was deleted, well Meuuh should know what I mean)
  * Cleaning of SDL Lock/Unlock Surface.
  * All plugins now compile with -fPIC.  
  * Made the audio_output API a bit simpler.
  * Got rid of modules_config.h.
  * Fixed `make install' rule. 
  * Fixed warnings in the MMX YUV compilation.
  * Probably fixed a bug in the input : pp_foo structures were free()d at
    the end, but this was useless since the last call to realloc() is
    equivalent to free(), and two consecutive calls to free() aren't a
    goo idea.   
  * We check that the version number match and that we don't already have
    a module by that name when loading a new module.
  * All public module_* functions now properly lock the module bank.
  * The audio_output now uses the new module API ; EsounD and DSP modules
    have been ported, which should be enough for Henri to port the ALSA one.
  * Added vlc_mutex_destroy and vlc_cond_destroy function, for pthreads.
    Used them before quitting, every lock and cond is destroyed
  * Checked the return value of malloc and realloc in input_programs
  * Fixed compilation pb under solaris 2.6
  * Should compile & run on Solaris with ./configure --disable-dsp
    (tested on puma)
  * Removed most SYS_SOLARIS #ifdef's in favour of more generic tests
  * Updated example ./configure line in INSTALL file
  * Now we only load modules that end with ".so"
  * null module is compiled by default
  * Fixed initialization of payload_start and payload_end
  * --enable-sdl and some others are now --with-sdl[=name] to supply an
    optional library name ;
  * Deleted all unnecessary #include <sys/uio.h> ;
  * /usr/include is now searched when looking for libraries and headers.
  * src/misc/modules.c is in a workable state now.
  * Splitted modules.h into modules.h and modules_core.h to enable
    clean compilation of the Null Module.
  * Added the Null Module, the module that does nothing but that is going
    to be of great help for debugging my module code.
  * Plugins are now called modules, because we will be able to compile
    them either as a dynamic plugin, or within the program. And, more
    important, I can commit this without having to break the vlc :)
  * Fixed pitch bug;
  * video_output.c : compute picture size even if b_need_render == 0;
  * Fixed a deadlock (the vout unlocked a mutex locked by another thread,
    grrrr, I'll kill someone) ;
  * Put config.h in front of others in audio_decoder.c.
  * Better display of the fps.
  * Removed i_iovec_start and i_iovec_end. Used i_data instead
  * Fixed THX Cimmarron bug (it was _not_ a synchro bug).
  * Fixed a bug in the DTS/PTS parsing ;
  * Fixed a bug in vpar_headers.c synchro handling introduced before ;
  * Enhanced synchro's handling of dates and frame structure changes.
  * Fixed a bug in the PSM decoder.
  * We now read the DTS (but we don't use it for the moment).
    NB : b_has_pts has disappeared for brevity reasons, use i_pts != 0 instead.
  * New synchro statistics and warnings.
  * Avoid calling SafeRead() with a null packet size.
  * Use of ptrdiff_t whenever necessary (IA-64 port) ;
  * Changed behaviour of preparsing code, faster startup ;
  * Fixed DecodePSM(), cannot test ;
  * Cleaned up ParsePES(), fixed a bug which could reject very small but
    valid PES packets ;
  * Fixed cosmetic bugs in vpar_synchro frame_rate display.
  * Changed subtitles palette.
  * SPU decoder now uses Meuuh's GetChunk() code.
  * Lots of cleaning in the SPU decoder.
  * Message queue is flushed before we spawn input.
  * Fixed so that it compiles with VDEC_SMP (no good sync yet though).
  * Using i_id instead of i_stream_id whenever possible ;
  * Fixed a bug in -c and -s options.
  * Fixed a compile pbm in debug mode (f34r d4 1-line fix)
  * Fixed AC3 and SPU PES reading (ph34r da one-byte patch)
  * Some 79 char wrap.
  * No need to add "\n" at the end of intf_*Msg() messages anymore.
  * Moved input_DecodePES() to input_dec.c ;
  * Fixed an segfault in input_programs.c ;
  * Added -fomit-frame-pointer optimization.
  * Fixed a *major* memory leak in the pre-parsing code. Hopefully it should
    be the last one.
  * New decoder spawning API input_dec.c ;
  * Moved p_input->pp_es -> p_input->stream.pp_es and clean up of
    input_programs.c & co ;
  * Fixed memory leaks.
  * Moved video_decoder's headers from include/ to src/video_decoder.
  * Temporarily removed b&w kludge.
  * Splitted up p_method_data/p_plugin_data ; 
  * Cleaned up input_ts.c, added it into the Makefile.
  * Fixed various memory leaks.
  * Removed all arbitrary limits on the number of elementary streams.
  * Removed b_die and b_error from all decoders (obsoleted by decoder_fifo_t).
    All decoders should now exit cleanly (if it's not the case, it should be
    referenced as a bug).
  * Fixed a bug which prevented the input to exit normally (non-selected
    ES in the pp_selected_es array).
  * Added netlist support.
  * Added U8_Mono audio output
  * Fixed "-a [ mpeg | ac3 | lpcm | off ]" option
  * Only pre-parse the first 32 MB of data.
  * Added -a, -c and -s options. (-a doesn't work but I will let the people
    who thought it would be cleaner to put config in environment variables
    correct what's wrong in my code).
  * Now we only try to open plugins which are existing files
  * Big cleanup of the PS input plugin ;
  * Fixed a bug in AC3 initialization ;
  * PS streams are now pre-parsed (this can take a while) if possible ;
  * Move #define from audio_output.h to config.h
  * Change vlan_server_ip to vishnou's ip (but vlans not working yet)
  * GetChunk() : reads n bytes from the elementary stream and places them
    in a big buffer (a gift for Sam).
  * Quantic start in fullscreen fixed.
  * Input-II now correctly handles private stream 1 (AC3, DVDSPU).
  * Split the audio decoder into adec_generic, adec_layer1 and adec_layer2
    (no new code added)
  * Added SDLYUV support,
  * Fixed the ratio/position problem in YUV,
  * We now display CPU usage statistics for each thread.
  * Additional fix for Layer 1 mono
  * Indentation fixes
  * Fixed audio syncword detection for mpeg 1 streams (hopefully)
  * Fixed Layer 2 Mono decoding.
  * Hardware YUV overlay (SDL) with real colors ;p It may suck for non
    4:2:0 streams.
  * Removed vout code found in intf file to support fullscreen switching.
    Now only vout_SDL updates SDL data and intf only switch flags such as
    b_reopen_display and b_fullscreen in p_vout->p_sys.
  * Fixed a var name typo in input_programs.c which prevents vlc from
    compiling with --enable-debug option. (i_es_pid -> i_es_id :)
  * Autodetection of Overlay support
  * Fixed support for broken MPEG-1 files.  
  * Cleaned up program and ES management by using input_programs.c whenever
    necessary.
  * Cleaned up decoder spawning.
  * Enhanced handling of stream discontinuities.
  * Fixed two typos in the Makefile (sam you owe me at least one beer)
  * Moved b_discontinuity to pgrm_descriptor_t, cleaned up CRDecode
    (needs some more cleaning for discontinuities)
  * Added pf_new_pes in plugins
  * Fix in the SCR parser for high values.
  * Fixed a bug with DVD's SCR (too close from the PTS).
  * Generation d'un makefile presque correct pour les vieilles versions de make
    Nettoyage: gestion des dependances pour les plugins, suppressions de pas
    mal de redondances, options de compilations coherentes, etc...
  * Code to manage es_descriptors and program_descriptors, from benny's
    input_psi.c
  * VLAN support modified.
  * We now correctly parse MPEG-1 SCR and there is no need to kludge to read
    the stream at the right pace.
  * Fixed a bug in the synchro with non-P5/B1 streams.
  * Support for MPEG-1 .mpg files.
  * Fixed a bug in the synchro with non-P5/B1 streams.
