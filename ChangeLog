  * v4l: patch from Carsten Gottbehüt (gottbehuet at active-elements dot de)
  -> Untested.

  Original message:
     Hi there,

     I have done another small modification. If you remove a hot-pluggable video
     device, like an usb web cam, during capturing, vlc floods the driver with
     ioctls. This leads to Kernel Ooops in some drivers.

     The modified v4l.c module does the following now:
     "GrabVideo" returns "VLC_ETIMEOUT" if the question "Did we wait long enough"
     can be answered with yes. If there is a real error in "GrabCapture" or
     "GrabMJPEG", the code "VLC_EGENERIC" is returned. So the calling function
     can distinguish between these two situations. "VLC_EGENERIC" was always
     returned before.
     The function "Read" uses this information to leave the while-loop in case of
     an error, and it returns a "-1" to the calling function. "Read" calls
     "msleep", as it was before, in case of a VLC_ETIMEOUT.

     The brightness-control stuff described below is still in the code. Please
     feel free to use, modify or ignore this file. A short feedback would be
     nice.

     Bye,

 Use playlist_Item* functions

2004-01-29 Thursday 17:51  zorglub

 Options as infos were bad in several ways: it broke PLAYLIST_GO, used
 much memory, and was inconsistent, especially with input_CreateThread
 taking an array of options

 * Revert to using array of options

 * To add an item with options:
     - either use playlist_ItemNew, ItemAddOption, and then AddItem
       (useful if you don't have all your options in an array)
     - either use playlist_AddExt (use this if all your options are
       already in an array)

 * To add an item without options: use playlist_Add

 You can still add options after an item has been added by using either
 playlist_AddOption or playlist_ItemAddOption

 * Attempt to improve API and solve thread safety issues.
   - playlist_Item* functions allow to touch items only.
     p_item->lock must be used when needed
     (playlist_ItemNew, playlist_ItemDelete, playlist_Item*Info,
      playlist_ItemSet* )

   - playlist_ItemGetById and ItemGetByPos give you playlist_items
     for GetByPos, you should have the playlist lock

 At the moment, the playlist_Set* and playlist_*Info functions are kept (they work with position) but should be avoided.

 * utils/var_bool.*: VarBool is now an interface for reading bool variables
  (not writing); use VarBoolImpl instead to instanciate read/write variables.
  Bool variables can now be combined with VarNotBool and VarBoolAndBool
  (TODO: VarBoolOrBool)
 * commands/cmd_show_window.hpp: the commands now call directly
   GenericWindow::show/hide, because the visibility variable of a
   window is a VarBool (so, read-only)
 * commands/cmd_input.hpp: added Play and Pause commands
 * parser/interpreter.cpp: beginning of support of boolean expressions,
  like "vlc.isSeekable and not vlc.isStopped" (operator precedence is
  not really well handled yet)
 * src/vlcproc.*: new variables "vlc.isSeekable", "vlc.isStopped" and
  "vlc.isPaused"
 * controls/ctrl_checkbox.cpp: the "state" variable of a checkbox is
   now a passive VarBool, so actions must be explicitely set with
   'action1="..." action2="..."' in the xml file
 * removed src/vlcvars.* => "vlc.isMute" doesn't work any more
  (anyway it didn't work well...)

  It applies for the last dst. selector1,selector2 means selector1 and

 Better operator association in computing duration and should be
 optimized better too.

 Add track info in "Media Information" Add track-specific information
 and album information in "Item info".

 Coding of all this is ugly and massively redundant. I think the
 playlist needs to be re-thought/re-worked. Sublevels would be nice
 too.

 What may be broken (untested):
 ------------------------------
    - Theora and Speex decoders
    - some interfaces
    - VCDX and CDDAX access

 The problems shouldn't hopefully excess compilation glitches.
 (removal of AddExt, of psz_author, and prototype of Add)

 Additionnaly, interfaces that do not support item-change will have
 update problems.

   src/playlist/item-ext.c
   src/playlist/group.c
   src/playlist/sort.c
   src/playlist/loadsave.c
   include/vlc_playlist.h
       - New playlist_info structures and accessors
         It works pretty like the old input_info (with categories)
         It provides modularity to the playlist
       - Removed ppsz_options and i_options from playlist_item
         (we use the special category Options)
       - Added a unique id to each playlist_item to be able to track the
         items accross playlist reorders
       - Simplified adding of items.
            - playlist_AddExt is removed
            - playlist_AddItem is still here and exported but should not be used
            - use playlist_Add( p_playlist, uri, name, duration, mode, pos )
              and use the accessors for all other things
       - Added setters for fields of the playlist_item structure
       - Introduced "item-change" and "playlist-current" playlist variables
         to give more flexibility than only intf-change

       At the moment, duration is still in the structure (easier to use, IMHO)

 * src/input/input.c

 * all: sample theme for skins2 interface
   Warning: by default the interface will try to open the skin from the
   vlc share, which is probably an old skin, so the load will fail, and
   afterwards a wxwindows dialog allows to load another skin.
   BUT there seems to be a bug which make the interface crash
   when it tries to load this second skin... workarounds are:
   - deleting the old theme
   - setting the "skin_last2=/path/to/xml/file" in the [Skins] section
   of vlcrc
   - solving the bug ;)

2004-01-03 Saturday 23:31  asmax

 * all: brand new skins interface ( still _experimental_) for x11 and
   win32, by ipkiss and myself...
  Among the features:
  - framework rewritten from scratch, heavily based on design patterns
   => new controls can be (hopefully) created more easily, portability
   to other OS is better, and the interface is less dependant from
   the vlc core
  - new concept of "layout", to provide a window with several different
   views (as in winamp3 skins)
  - controls can now be placed at a relative position to the edges of
   a window, which allow controls and layouts to be resizable (e.g
   for the playlist window)
  - Use of libpng and libfreetype2 for better portability between x11 and
    win32 => ttf fonts and antialiasing
  - New DTD for the xml theme ( *it will probably change again* )
  - Very very beginning of scripting in the xml file
  - And many things I miss
  - And probably many bugs ;)
