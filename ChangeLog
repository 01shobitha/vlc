 Fixed segmentation fault in input_SplitBuffer() when input_FillBuffer() could not allocate (actually input_NewBuffer()) another buffer. The code tested for:
 if (!i_size)
 {
   /* Handle error */
 }

 However input_SplitBuffer() returns -1, which results in if (false) here and a segmentation fault will happen when input_ShareBuffer() is called. All constructs of the above form are supicious to produce a segfault in the code!

  ts: large rewrite of the TS muxer to produce better TS and support DVD
      subtitle.
      I have added some options:
         - bmin : minimum bitrate (bits/s) of the TS. Padding is added in
         case of insuffisant bitrate. (default: disabled).
         - bmax : maximum bitrate (bit/s) of the TS. It just drops packets
         to achieve the target. (default: disabled)
         - pcr : minimum delay between two pcr equal to dts of the video
         stream (default 100ms)
         - pcr-soft : minimum delay between two pcr interpolated from the
         pcr that are equal to dts. (default: none)
  Remarks:
   - bmin/bmax allow to create CBR stream.
   - Bitrate is calculated on a PCR time.
   - PCR delay cannot be less than length of a frame of the PCR stream.
   - PCR soft is used to help when using big PCR delay. It is usefull to
   produce stream with smoother bitrate variation.
   - Big PCR delay introduce more latency.

 * Brought the new options system to the OSX gui.
   and some small fixes.

2003-07-27 Sunday 21:35  jpsaman

 Gtk2 port of the familiar Linux interface. The name is also changed to PDA so it reflects that it is targeted at handhelds.

 The familiar interface itself is deprecreated and will be removed after the next stable version of VLC Media Player.

2003-07-27 Sunday 16:20  gbazin

 * modules/audio_output/alsa.c: #ifdef DEBUG -> #ifdef ALSA_DEBUG

2003-07-27 Sunday 16:14  gbazin

 * modules/audio_output/alsa.c: bail out if the device is already in use.

2003-07-27 Sunday 15:49  gbazin

2003-07-27 Sunday 14:10  massiot

 * src/input/input_clock.c: Fixed two long-standing (> 2 years) bugs
 - there should be fewer resampling, particularly on DVD chapter changes
 - when you unpause a DVD, VLC will wait for the drive to spin up, so you
 won't lose several seconds of movies

 * modules/gui/macosx/controls.m: Seeking in paused mode resumes the play
 mode, make the interface take that into account.

2003-07-27 Sunday 12:31  ipkiss

  * All: Removed the win32 plugin; wxwindows rulez :)

2003-07-26 Saturday 12:41  gbazin

 * modules/gui/wxwindows/open.cpp: workaround design problems in wxSpinCtrl (wxSpinCtrl::GetValue() triggers a value update event).

2003-07-25 Friday 22:50  gbazin

 * modules/gui/wxwindows/*: fixed clean-up of the dialogs provider on exit.
 * modules/gui/skins/x11/*: proper initialization of a global var so we can start/exit the skins interface several times.

2003-07-25 Friday 13:24  gbazin

 * INSTALL.win32: updated build instructions (btw since the last build changes, mingw+msys can be used again to compile VLC).
 * modules/gui/wxwindows/wxwindows.cpp: oops.

2003-07-25 Friday 11:37  gbazin

2003-07-24 Thursday 22:58  gbazin

 * src/misc/modules.c: if module_Need() was passed an interface module name, respect this choice even if vlc was run with a specific interface shortcut.

2003-07-24 Thursday 22:05  sam

   * modules/access/v4l/v4l.c:
     + Removed my name from this file, I didn't contribute anything major to it.
     + Added strerror(errno) where adequate, as well as additional debug
       information, hopefully more useful than "cannot open".

2003-07-24 Thursday 21:50  gbazin

 * modules/gui/wxwindows/*: you can now specify input options in the stream output MRL as well.
 * modules/misc/freetype.c: bail out if no font has been specified.
 * modules/demux/util/sub.h: don't forget to detach the demuxsub object.

2003-07-24 Thursday 20:34  sam

     + Run autopoint with the -f flag.
     + Remove stamp files in the bootstrap process.

2003-07-24 Thursday 19:30  sigmunau

 ignore CR characters wherever they might be.
 A little better line spaceing, but I still don't understand what this is all
 about.

2003-07-24 Thursday 19:07  sigmunau

 fixed a nasty code duplication where the same function call was two places
 with just a few lines in between, but in separate #if cases.

2003-07-24 Thursday 18:30  bigben

 * "frequency=" is channel frequency in kHz again

 * fix  a segfault when "/dev/video0"  or "norm=" were last  arguments of

2003-07-24 Thursday 18:27  bigben

 * Changes "frequency=" syntax. New syntax is channel frequency in kHz
 * shows a warning if frequency is in "previous syntax range"

2003-07-24 Thursday 17:31  gbazin

 * modules/gui/wxwindows/open.cpp: compilation fix.

2003-07-24 Thursday 16:07  gbazin

 * modules/gui/wxwindows/*: added support for input options in the open dialog.
    The stream output and subtitles options use them and you can also add options in the MRL itself.

2003-07-23 Wednesday 23:05  gbazin

 * modules/misc/freetype.c, modules/demux/util/sub.c: cleanup.
 * modules/demux/util/sub.h: thou shall do a vlc_object_attach().

 * Updated po files. STRINGS ARE FROZEN !!!

2003-07-23 Wednesday 22:02  jpsaman

 Interface for Familiar v0.7 and GPE. This interface is based on gtk2 libaries.

2003-07-23 Wednesday 22:01  gbazin

 * include/variables.h, src/misc/variables.c: you can now use var_Create() directly to create an object variable with an inherited value.
    eg. var_Create( p_vout, "zoom", VLC_VAR_FLOAT | VLC_VAR_DOINHERIT );
    Beware, the object in which you create the var must be attached to a parent for this to work (otherwise we can't navigate the parents hierarchy to find the value to inherit).

 * src/input/input.c, src/input/input_programs.c, src/video_output/video_output.c: converted more config_GetFoo() into var_Create()/var_Get();

2003-07-23 Wednesday 21:45  hartman

 * include/vlc_common.h: MAX_PATH PATH_MAX, we don't wanna bother and use the
   latter everywhere.
 * modules/demux/util/sub.c: Bring the config options in here to the variable structure.
 * modules/misc/freetype.c: Bring the config options in here to the variable structure.
   Fix the linespacing. Dnumgis, it works, just define another linespacing :)

  freetype.c : use the default BeOS font on BeOS

2003-07-23 Wednesday 17:31  ipkiss

  * modules/gui/skins/src/banks.cpp: removed a useless event I had
    forgotten

2003-07-23 Wednesday 09:14  asmax

 * all: fixed depcomp failure

2003-07-23 Wednesday 07:37  jpsaman

 When recv() returns -1 a bug is triggered inside RTPRead() and RTPChoose(). The return value of Read() is then -1. The test "if (!i_ret) return 0;" will be false and the function will continue resulting in segfault while copying from buffers that are in an undetermined state. The correct test is "if (i_ret<0) return 0;".

2003-07-23 Wednesday 01:28  gbazin

 * modules/misc/sap.c: oops, compilation fix.

2003-07-23 Wednesday 01:13  gbazin

 * ALL: changes to the playlist_Add() and VLC_AddTarget() proto to include a list of options associated with the input.
 * src/input/input.c: parses the input options list before spawning the input and create object variables for these options. Options are of the form "[no[-]]foo[=bar]" where foo is the option name and bar is its value.
 * src/input/input.c, src/input/input_dec.c: use the object var api to get the value of the "sout", "sout-video" and "sout-audio" options.
 * src/libvlc.c: extended the command line parser to parse input options. Input options must always follow the input they apply to and begin with a ':'.

 All these changes allow you to specify input specific options.
 eg: ./vlc --no-sout-audio yourvideo.mpeg :sout=udp/http::8080 :sout-audio yourvideo2.mpeg
 Here the ":sout" option will only apply to yourvideo.mpeg.
 "--no-sout-audio" will be a global option so will apply to yourvideo2.mpeg but the global behaviour is overriden by ":sout-audio" for yourvideo.mpeg.

 TODO: - the interfaces need to be modified to benefit from the new playlist_Add() api.
       - only "sout", "sout-video", "sout-audio" implemented for now. To make it work with other options, we need to get rid of all the config_GetFoo() and replace them with var_Create()/var_Change()/var_Get().

2003-07-22 Tuesday 22:02  hartman

 * Fix Makefiles for removed .rle fonts

2003-07-22 Tuesday 20:49  hartman

 frequency is  nom frequency  in MHz * 16, as  for the  v4l input.
 Breaks compatibility with previous syntax...

2003-07-22 Tuesday 18:06  gbazin

 * src/stream_output/stream_output.c: fixed segfault when muxer can't add an elementary stream.

2003-07-22 Tuesday 15:59  gbazin

 * src/misc/variables.c: fixed small mem leak (courtesy of Andy Lindsay)
 * modules/gui/wxwindows/interface.cpp: small improvements to the volume control.

2003-07-22 Tuesday 13:58  bigben

 * We're finally parsing all parameters (including standard)
 * syntax is now (roughly) the same as for the v4l input
 ex : vlc pvr:/dev/video0:frequency=1242:norm=secam:size=12x42:bitrate=1200,maxbitrate=4200
 * old syntax is still working
 * norm can be "pal", "secam", "ntsc" or any hexa value

2003-07-21 Monday 23:53  fenrir

  * http: added "del" and "empty" control. (for playlist). Corrected
 "previous" command.

2003-07-20 Sunday 16:26  sigmunau

 Draw the text in the U and V planes as well. Removes the transparency effect.
 Also check which chroma is in use and give an error message if it isn't
 supported.

 Someone (possibly me) should write some renderer functions for other
 colorspaces.

2003-07-20 Sunday 15:33  gbazin

 * Added MPEG 1 to the list of encapsulation methods (useful to produce files playable by WMP).

2003-07-20 Sunday 15:17  gbazin

2003-07-20 Sunday 12:34  sigmunau

 some cleanup in file info code, add fourccs in hex form ( some users want
 that ), add audio bitrate when available (untested)

2003-07-20 Sunday 12:22  gbazin

 * modules/gui/wxwindows/preferences.cpp: windows can't have open _and_ save file dialogs so only use open file dialogs on win32 in the preferences menu.
 * Makefile.am: removed INSTALL.win32 from the win32 package as it's only useful for developpers anyway.

2003-07-20 Sunday 10:38  gbazin

2003-07-18 Friday 23:50  hartman

 * add a #include <errno.h>

2003-07-18 Friday 23:41  hartman

 * Add -liconv to the ldflags of the spudec module.
 * Add -framework Carbon to the ldflags of the spudec module when Carbon is
   present. freetype-config unfortunatly omits this on MacOSX.

 I think I did this correctly, but it might be wise to review this :)

2003-07-18 Friday 20:52  gbazin

 * src/libvlc.h: disabled the encoders config options (encoders are not used anymore, all the encoding is done in the stream output transcode module).
 * src/misc/win32_specific.c: added an --high-priority config option on win32 to increase the priority of the process (default enabled for now so the behaviour isn't changed.)

2003-07-17 Thursday 17:30  gbazin

 * modules/gui/wxwindows/*: The wxwindows interface is now a "dialogs provider" module as well as a normal "interface".
    Dialog providers expose an api that allow other modules to use the GUI dialogs the module provides (open dialogs, etc...).
    + misc small enhancements.

 * modules/gui/skins/*: completely removed the dependancy on the wxwindows code (which also eliminates the need for the basic_skins module).
    The skins module will now try to load a "dialogs provider" to display the open, messages, file info and preferences dialogs.

     + Use ${misc:Depends} everywhere.

2003-07-17 Thursday 12:06  sam

   * mozilla/Makefile.am: Moved mozilla plugin generation directives here.

   * modules/video_output/x11/xcommon.c: Select events in the video subwindow
     instead of the base window, because newer versions of Mozilla select
     ButtonPress for the window it gives us, and XSelectInput only allows
     one client to select this event.

2003-07-15 Tuesday 18:12  sigmunau

 All: My shot at improving subtitle rendering in vlc. Now each vout uses a "text renderer" module to render text on the video when needed. I decieded to make this a module type, because other api's (win32 and macosx) is supposed to do better than freetype under some circumstances.

 include/video_output.h: added some members needed by text renderer modules
 src/video_output/video_output.c: load and unload text renderer module when needed
 src/video_output/video_text.c: implemented some functions to show text on the video
 include/osd.h: exported the functions to show text
 modules/misc/Modules.am, module/misc/freetype.c: new text renderer module, largly based on the old osdtext module.
 modules/video_filter/Modules.am, modules/video_filter/osd_text.c: removed the osdtext module
 configure.ac: changes "osdtext" to "freetype" some places
 modules/codec/spudec/*: when iconv is available, use it to convert textual subtitles from the encoding given by --sub-encoding to utf8. Use new code to render subtitles
 modules/control/lirc/lirc.c: use new code to give feedback on buttons pressed. untested.
 modules/demux/util/sub.c: remove all traces of the ugly old osdtext module
 modules/misc/dummy/*: added a "text renderer" submodule in the dummy module
 src/misc/modules.c: included osd.h as it seems to be needed to export symbols

 final notes: you need to give a proper value to --freetype-font. This should be the path to a font file freetype2 can handle (almost any format afaik) with a unicode translation table in it. Windows ttf files will do. In linux at least openoffice distributes some fonts that work. I think macosx and beos also has useable fonts.

 toolbox: made a --add-include that can be used by doxygen to get proper
          includes in the .h files, since they are parsed out of context by
 	 doxygen
 Doxyfile: misc fixes, use ./toolbox --add-include as filter for sources.
 include/vlc_common.h: doxygenized VLC_COMMON_MEMBERS

 With these changes, and a slightly patched version of doxygen (which you can
 get here: http://www.idi.ntnu.no/~sigmunau/doxygen-vlcpatched.tgz ) you should
 be able to get some useful documentation out of the vlc sources.

   the presence of a descriptor).

 hope documentations.

  TODO: - (re)implement access control in httpd (but in a useable way).

   It works now, but now i'm running into the black screen and continous
   "late picture skipped (-218000)" again which is also plagueing us when you
   enter fullscreen with a filter enabled. This ought to be fixed before 0.6.0

 Note: There are still a few bugs in the code handling the controls and
 their different states, and I think they will be difficult to fix with
 the current code structure. A rewrite of this part of code could be a
 good idea (perhaps using states and transitions between states, like
 Zinf does?).

  * src/input/input_ext-intf.c :  added an input_SetRate function; it is
    quite more convenient than, e.g, calling input_SetStatus( STATUS_FASTER )
    two times if you want to switch from 1:1 to 4:1 from the interface.
    Old functions still work.
  * modules/gui/beos/VlcWrapper.cpp : use it

2003-05-31 Saturday 01:23  fenrir

  * mjpeg grabbing added, thanks to Paul Forgey <paulf at aphrodite dot com>
  that had done all the work.

 Paul Forgey's notes:
 --------------------

 Unfortunatley, the v4l interface shows how much it sucks here.  I can't
 wait for v4l2 to become more common.  Anyway, the mjpeg mechanism
 captures completely differently than the uncompressed frame capture
 mechanism.  This means the code has to split off a bunch to do similar
 things depending on mjpeg being set or not.  For some reason, I can't
 use non v4l2 calls to capture uncompressed frames from the lml33,
 however I do have another bttv card on my system to test that I didn't
 break the non-mjpeg stuff.

 The Zoran encoders don't use square pixels.  So the 4:3 (or 16:9)
 picture is going to show up as 720x480.  I don't know my way around the
 code well enough to know how to specify a non-square pixel aspect
 ratio.  If there isn't a way to do it, it would be nice to be able to
 specify as an option the aspect ratio of the sourc.  Either 4:3 or 16:9
 in the case of anamorphic S-Video, which does occur.

 I stole the videodev_mjpeg.h header from the lavrec project.  Despite
 the linux kernels having support for the Zoran cards, there doesn't seem
 to be a reliable way to pick up this header, which is probably why
 lavrec did it this way.  Since it only defines ioctl definitions, I
 don't think using it is a legal problem.

 I also modified the audio handling a bit.  If the card supports audio,
 great, we'll set the card's parameters as we did before.  But if adev=
 is specified, use it regardless.  The reason to do this is to capture
 audio from the sound card with video coming from, say, a web cam or in
 my case, an encoder card which doesn't have any audio capabilities at
 all.

 . SAP/SDP packets parsing: ability to parse RFC compliant packets
   parse_sap returns the SAP header length
   parse_sdp only parse the SDP payload

   - did some cleaning up. this might just work under Win32 now aswell,
     gibalou will do some testing tomorrow ;)
   - SVQ3 QT degrades faster then the ffmpeg version, but also recovers
     faster. I'm not yet sure which one i prefer.

 modify/apply on all streams, --sout has the same behavour expect when
 starting with a '#'.

  With a starting '#' you can specify a chain of modules, it's still
 unstable but a lot more powerfull.
  You have access to duplicate(that duplicate all stream), transcode
 (using only ffmpeg), standard/std and es (that apply muxers and access),
 and display. You could chain them with ':' and specify options with
 {option1=value,option2=value[,...]}.

 ex: * to stream and see the stream to udp/ts:ip
  --sout '#duplicate{dst=display,dst=std{access=udp,mux=ts,url=ip}}'
     * to transcode,see and stream
  --sout '#transcode{acodec=mpga}:duplicate{dst=display,dst=std{access=udp,mux=ts,url=ip}}'

  Without a starting '#', the url is converted into '#std{acces=,mux=,url}'

 * user-friendly(?) build system, based on linux Menuconfig script.
   Just run ./menuconfig and ./build-vlc (or just ./build-vlc)
   It's actually a wrapper which calls configure, but only a small number
   of vlc functionalities has been implemented at the moment.
   Please try it however ;)
   (you must have libncurses-dev installed)

2003-04-11 Friday 19:15  sam

           a factor), audio, size (WxH or subqcif,qsif,qcif,sif,cif,vga),

    plugins matching the given shortcuts list, unless "none" is closing the
    list (in which case only the plugins matching the list can be selected).

    Which means that users will stop complaining vlc doesn't launch anymore
    or can't play anything after they have fiddled with their config
    options :))

2003-03-25 Tuesday 00:43  gbazin

 * src/video_output/video_output.c: fixed my previous commit (input is not a direct parent of vout).

2003-03-24 Monday 23:50  gbazin

 * modules/access/*: don't forget to reinitialize the timeout when looping around select().

2003-03-24 Monday 17:15  gbazin

 * modules/access/*: pf_read() in access modules is now blocking. We still
    check regularly for p_input->b_die though. Now the demuxers can safely
    assume that pf_read() == 0 means EOF.
 * ALL: got rid of the p_input->b_connected flag.
 * src/input/input_ext-plugins.c, src/input/input.c: fixed the infinite loop
    of "decoder stuck" messages that sometimes happened.
 * src/interface/intf_eject.c, modules/misc/network/ipv4.c: fixed compilation
    warnings.

2003-03-24 Monday 15:20  hartman

 * modules/access/directory.c: fixed the directory access plugin.
 * configure.ac.in, modules/access/Modules.am: enabled the directory access plugin.

2003-03-24 Monday 00:12  hartman

 * a new directory access module. It parses a directory with dirent and builds
   a m3u 'file' which it feeds to the m3u demuxer.
   Problems: - it requires a dir to end with /
             - if i enabled it, all files would use the m3u demuxer for some
             strange reason. i've spent a day hunting this down, reboot-
             strapping and doing who knows what. I'm sick of it now.
             Someone else can give it a try, if he wants to.

2003-03-23 Sunday 20:41  gbazin

 * configure.ac.in: fixed linking problem with the win32 build.

 modules/video_filter/osd_text.c: A video filter that uses freetpye2 to
 render text on the video
 include/osd.h: some constants useful when interfacing with the osd module
 configure.ac.in: check for freetype2, enabled the osdtext module by default
 Makefile.am: added osd.h, please check that this is correct
 lirc.c: modified to provide feedback when buttons are pressed.

 Look at the Feedback() function in lirc.c to see how this module can be used

2003-03-23 Sunday 15:10  yves

 better OS detection (RH).

2003-03-23 Sunday 12:12  gbazin

 Compilation fixes and cosmetic changes

 * modules/gui/macosx/vout.m:
   Reworked the mouse hiding routine. we were always hiding the mousecursor
   on kCGDirectMainDisplay, but this display is always the one with the
   menubar and not always the one containing our VLCVout.
   This new code takes the vout, and calculates on which displays (plural
   because of possible mirroring) it is being shown. It then shows or hides
   the cursor on all of those displays.
   This should fix #396.

   - this is 3ivx D4 video
   - it is mpeg 4 compliant and ffmpeg decodes it, via MPEG4.

 * added fourcc '3ivd' to .avi, .mov and ffmpeg.
   - this is video which was divx doctored by the 3ivx doctor program.
   - it is normal DIV3 video and ffmpeg decodes it via MPEG4 v3.

 * added fourcc '3vid' to .avi, .mov and ffmpeg.
   - this is incorrect encoded DIV3. it is an endianness issue by the encoder.
   - ffmpeg can decode it however, so it is mapped to MPEG4 v3.

 * modules/gui/macosx/applescript.?
 * extras/MacOSX/Resources/vlc.scriptSuite
 * extras/MacOSX/Resources/English.lproj/vlc.scriptTerminology
   - moved existing applescript commands to these files
   - added several control commands. supported are: play/pause, stop,
     previous, next, fullscreen, mute, volumeUp and volumeDown.
     These correspond to the existing menuitems. This still requires work
     in the future to make it more correct AppleScript, but it works for now.

 * modules/gui/macosx/controls.?
   - split up the controls.m into a .m and a .h

 * modules/gui/macosx/intf.?
   - added a getControls method to gain access to the controller object from
     the AppleScript commands.

 * modules/gui/macosx/open.?
   - removed the applescript support existing here and moved it to applescript.?

 * modules/gui/macosx/playlist.m
   - made the tooltips for the add and remove buttons localizable.

 * src/input/input_ext-plugins.c: added an msleep() call in case we fail to
    allocate a new buffer in input_FillBuffer(). This is necessary because
    the input thread has an high priority and we don't want it to loop
    without any interruption.

 ALL:

 * include/configuration.h: added a new flag to the configuration stucture to
 indicate wether it is an "advanced" option or not. The goal with this is to
 hide the user from all the strange options that very seldom needs to be
 changed. added an extra argument to all the add_* macros to indicate wether
 the item is advanced or not.
 * src/libvlc.h: added an "show advanced options" config option default
 disabled
 * src/libvlc.c: the advanced options are not listed by vlc --help and
 friends unless --advanced is used
 * modules/gtk/preferences.c: the gtk/gnome preferences dialog don't show
 advanced options unless advanced is set
 all: set the advanced flag to VLC_FALSE or VLC_TRUE for all options, by
 using some common sense. Please check and correct

 note: All interfaces should still work like they used to, see the change in
 modules/gtk/preferences.c to find out how to "hide" options.

 second note: I think I've changed all the modules, but I could not test
 everyone for compilation, expect some broken modules (the fix is to add ",
 VLC_TRUE" as last argument to the add_* I forgot)

 		separated ApplyChanges() into more functions
 		to have finer control

 	- added more error checking and fixed memory leaks
 		(config_GetPsz() returns char*, not const char*!)

 	- all settings are now correctly saved and restored

 	- some more cosmetic changes

 modules/gui/beos/InterfaceWindow.h/.cpp

 	- updated vlc way of saving settings to be on par with BeOS way
 		and made it selectable in the code which way is used.
 		However, the VideoSettings are still only savable in
 		the BeOS way.

 	- if dvd menus are used, the navigation menu enables a
 		"Goto Menu" item. Unfortunately, I don't see a clean
 		way to really detect the usage of dvd/dvdold in the
 		currently playing stream. I wouldn't want to see
 		if a playlist item has "dvd:" or "dvdold:" prepended
 		at each interface update.

 * modules/codec/spudec/spudec.c, modules/codec/spudec/text.c: fixed the
    race condition between spudec and vout. This patch may not be all that
    nice because it does a lot of vlc_object_find() but it is the only
    solution I've been able to come-up with.
    Oh and I didn't fix the memory leak caused by the font when using text
    subtitles. If the vout changes while the spudec is running then we don't
    unload this font.
