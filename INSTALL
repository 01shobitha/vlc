Building VideoLAN
=================

A typical way to configure the vlc is :

   ./configure --prefix=/usr --enable-ppro --enable-mmx --enable-gnome

See `./configure --help' for more information.

Then, run `make', and `make install' to install it.


To build a Debian package, you may use :

   dpkg-buildpackage -rfakeroot -us -uc


To build RedHat packages, use :

   rpm -ba vlc.spec


Installing and running VideoLAN

You can install the vlc and its plugins by typing :

But you don't need to do it if you don't want ; vlc can be launched
from the current directory as well :

   ./vlc
