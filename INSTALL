INSTALL file for the VLC media player

More extensive information for *nix, Windows, Mac OS X and BeOS users can be found here:

Bootstrapping VLC
=================

If you retrieved VLC from the SVN server and do not have a "configure"
script, please refer to the HACKING file.

Configuring VLC
===============

A typical way to configure VLC is:

   ./configure --prefix=/usr --enable-wxwindows

See `./configure --help' for more information.

If you intend to debug stuff, you may want to compile with debugging
symbols:

   make distclean ; ./configure --prefix=/usr --enable-wxwindows --enable-debug

We recommend using GCC (versions 3.3 or later) to build VLC, though some
people reported success with the Intel C compiler (version 8) as well. As of
VLC version 0.9.0, GCC 2.95 is not supported anymore; if this is the default
compiler on your system (e.g. FreeBSD 4.x), please select a more recent
version manually by setting the CC and CXX environment variables
appropriately while running the ./configure shell script.


Building VLC
============

Have a look at the generated Makefile.opts file, you may want to choose
which modules will be compiled as plugins, and which ones will remain in
the core application. The configure script tries to guess for you.

Once configured, run `make' to build VLC.


Installing and running VLC
==========================

You can install the VLC and its plugins by typing:

   make install

But you don't need to install it if you don't want to; VLC can be launched
from the current directory as well:

   ./vlc


Building packages
=================

To build a Debian package, you need to get the packaging info
   svn co svn://svn.videolan.org/pkg-multimedia/unstable/vlc/debian debian 
and then
   dpkg-buildpackage -rfakeroot -us -uc


To build RedHat packages, use:

   rpm -ba vlc.spec

To build an ipkg package (iPAQ familiar Linux), use:

   ipkg-buildpackage
