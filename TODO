Description: Vout redesign
- vout needs distinct splitting into vout_core, vout_window, pic_filter, vout_filter
- needs 'assistence' vout windows (clone filters, goom) etc.
- 4:3, 16:9, freeform Aspect Ratio
- cropping and padding (do at OS level, but provide a core call to set it up and configure).
- OSD at window resolution instead of video res (secondary vout channel)
- a OSD needs to be bound to a vout stream (no subs on goom vout)
- Use OS native calls where appropriate, with 'C' fallbacks. (OpenGL, Quartz, DirectX already has many of the funtionalities we seek and sometimes they are a lot faster too).
