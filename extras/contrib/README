This is the contrib build system for VLC Media Player. It has been
primarily developed for Mac OS X, though it should be easy to adapt to
other operating systems.

To use it, first in the contrib directory, type :
	./bootstrap

Customize config.mak if you need to, then you need to choose between
building from source (can take a long time but is easily customizable)
and fetching a pre-compiled binary package. Either type 'make src'
or 'make bin' (also from the contrib directory).

Once the contribs are built, you can start building VLC.
See: http://developers.videolan.org/vlc/osx-compile.html 
for more details on that.

Happy hacking.
