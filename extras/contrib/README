This is the contrib build system for VLC Media Player. It has been
primarily developed for Mac OS X, though it should be easy to adapt to
other operating systems.

To use it, first type :
	./bootstrap

Customize config.mak if you need type, then you need to choose between
building from source (can take a long time but is easily customizable)
and fetching a pre-compiled binary package. Either type 'make src'
or 'make bin'.

Once the contribs are built, you can start building VLC. VLC's bootstrap
and configure scripts will automatically detect the contrib directory,
but you still need to specify which plug-ins you want to build (though
it is unnecessary to add --with-* or --with-*-tree). For instance my
configure line is :
	./configure --disable-x11 --disable-xvideo --disable-gtk --disable-sdl --enable-ffmpeg --with-ffmpeg-mp3lame --enable-mad --enable-libdvbpsi --enable-a52 --enable-dvdplay --enable-faad --enable-vorbis --enable-theora --enable-ogg --enable-slp --enable-flac --enable-libmpeg2 --enable-mkv --enable-speex --enable-debug

Then for Darwin, 'make' will build the VLC.app application and copy the
contrib libs to VLC.app/Contents/MacOS/lib. The application is ready.

Happy hacking.
