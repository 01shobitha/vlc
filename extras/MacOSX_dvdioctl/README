DVD driver for Darwin and Mac OS X
==================================

This experimental kernel extension (KEXT) for Darwin is a wrapper for
the DVD-related kernel IOKit functions. It was written for two main reasons:

  - the lack of userland support for DVD key negociation functions
  - the fact that the kernel locks mounted device, preventing raw device
    reads if the DVD is mounted

Building the driver
===================

You can either load the project in Project Builder and press the "build"
icon, or open a terminal window and type "pbxbuild".

Installing the driver
=====================

Open a terminal window, and type "kextload build/DVDioctl.kext", or whatever
the path to the build tree is. You need to be root in order to do this.

Using the driver
================

The driver creates a special /dev/dvd block device upon loading. When a
process tries to open this device, it looks for an IODVDMedia object and
opens it. All further operation done to the /dev/dvd device are then
forwarded to the IODVDMedia device.
