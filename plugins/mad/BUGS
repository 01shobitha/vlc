bug #09/11/2001-1: (FIXED 20/11/2001, by JP Saman)
	Makefile.opts.in and Makefile.opts static libmad.a library is not filled in automatically by configure.
	It should say in Makefile.opts LIB_MAD=lib/libmad.a

bug #09/11/2001-2: (FIXED december 2001)
	Libmad is not included in the vlc source code. It is assumed that the library is already available on the machine
	where the plugin is compiled on. The configure option --with-libmad tells the script where libmad.a or libmad.so library
	and mad.h include file are installed. E.g. if libmad.a is in /usr/lib and mad.h is in /usr/include then the configure
	option should be --with-libmad=/usr

bug #12/11/2001-1 (WORKING, by JP Saman)
	smoothen out audio in libmad_output callback function, by optimizing conversion routines. After investigation
	and experimenting I found out that my input routine and output routine were not balanced correctly with
	respect to buffer sizes. A lot of data got lost. I fixed that, but still need a bater scaling/smoothing routine
	for the audio.
	I tried a simpler audio scale function, but it did not improve the audio much. Not even on Intel machine, so I suspect the audio
	decoding to need a bit too much time. The next thing to try is to steer the decoding process by hand (going to a lower level API).
	This means a complete replace of mad_libmad.c and mad_libmad.h files.

bug #20/11/2001-1 (FIXED 25/11/2001, by JP Saman)
	synchronization between audio and video output is lost. In libmad_output a timestamp is set on the audio data, but
	it points to a later video frame, then when the audio data was read. How can I set the correct timestamp on the
        audio fifo at the time it was read from the bitstream, so that it matches the video frame it belongs to?
        Solution: Do it in two steps, in the input function save i_pts of fifo and in output function pass saved i_pts to
        aout_fifo.
