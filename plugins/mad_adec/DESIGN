File:	Plugin mad for vlc is based upon libmad from the mad distribution.
Author: Jean-Paul Saman <jpsaman@wxs.nl>

Directories:
============
vlc/			: adapted config.in and Makefile
			: added libtool, ltmain.sh and ltconfig
vlc/extras/libmad	: libmad from the original mad distribution
vlc/plugins/mad_adec	: mad audio decoder plugin for vlc

Interface functions to implement in mad plugin are:
=========
adec_mad_Probe
adec_mad_Run
adec_mad_Init
adec_mad_ErrorThread
adec_mad_EndThread

libmad_input
libmad_output
libmad_header
libmad_messages

Design: (ASCII art)
=======
It represents the function call flow viewed from the vlc main program. The main program is in charge of allocating decoders,
initializing, starting and stopping them.

Interface view:
===============
			   	  [mad_adec decoder plugin]
 				   ----------------------
	vlc decoder interface -> | mad_adec 	mad_libmad | -> libmad
                            	   -----------------------

Rationel:
Keeping libmad as a separate library, either dynamic or statically linked in, makes maintenance so much simpeler.
Merging with a new libmad version should be straight forward as long as the interface stays stable.
There is another benefit: Disk (actually flash ROM) resources and memory are very limited on a iPaq.
Other programs or utilities like madplay and BBplay can make use of the same libmad version we do. In this way
limiting the needed storage place on disk (flash ROM). Also this is only possible when the interface stays the same.
