<question><para>How do I read a DVD?</para></question>

<answer><para>Just launch VLC and use the "open disc" command from the graphical
interface. In case of trouble, you may want to use the command line.
For instance, provided your DVD device is <filename>/dev/dvd</filename> :</para>

<screen><prompt>% </prompt><userinput>vlc dvd:/dev/dvd</userinput></screen>

</answer></qandaentry>

<qandaentry>

<question><para>How do I read an encrypted DVD?</para></question>

<answer><para>It is exactly the same as for a normal DVD. You will
need write access to <filename>/dev/dvd</filename>, because of the key
negociation process.

If you compiled your VLC by hand, please bear in mind that you also need
to install libdvdcss. It can be downloaded from the VideoLAN website. It
used to be distributed in the same package as VLC, but now you must install
them seperately.

<question><para>VLC eats my buffer cache, how can I use raw device?</para></question>

<answer><para>If you do not know what is a raw device, do not even read
this answer :-).</para>

<para>There is an experimental support for raw devices in libdvdcss. It
needs that you set up a raw device pointing to your DVD device (under
Linux, use the "raw" utility). Then pass the raw device as second
argument, for instance:</para>

<screen><prompt>% </prompt><userinput>vlc dvd:/dev/dvd@/dev/raw0</userinput></screen>

<question><para>How do I use VLC as a client for VLS
streaming?</para></question>

<answer><para>First you must set up a VLS stream. Please refer to the
documentation of the program. Then start VLC:</para>

<screen><prompt>% </prompt><userinput>vlc udp:</userinput></screen>

<para>You should not need any option. If you are paranoid and want to control
everything, here is the exact syntax:</para>

<screen><prompt>% </prompt><userinput>vlc udp:[&lt;server&gt;[:&lt;server port&gt;]][@[&lt;bind address&gt;][:&lt;bind port&gt;]]</userinput></screen>

<question><para>How do I uninstall / reinstall VLC?</para></question>

<answer><para>Why would you want to? ;)</para>

<para>If you are using a source distribution of VLC, for example
a tarball or the CVS, then you have probably used <command>make
install</command> to install the compiled VLC. To remove it just
<command>make uninstall</command>. If you want to install a newer
version than the currently installed one, you should first uninstall
the first one. If you deleted the original source tree, a <command>make
uninstall</command> in the newer tree should still work.</para>

<para>For binary packages, remove old packages first and install the new
ones (normally this should be handled automagically by your sytem).

<question><para>How can I save my VLC configuration?</para></question>

<answer><para>Currently, the only way to save the configuration options
in VLC is through the preferences menu in one of the graphical user
interface plugins.

</para></answer></qandaentry>

<qandaentry>

<question><para>Where does VLC store its config file?</para></question>

<answer><para>Currently, a config file is created on a per user basis
(there is no global configuration file). If you modify the available
options in VLC and save the new configuration, then a configuration file
will be created in your user directory. The precise location of this
file depends on the Operating System you are running: </para>

<qandadiv><title>Troubleshooting</title>

<qandaentry>

<question><para>When I start VLC, I do not see any interface
coming</para></question>

<answer><para>If you installed a binary package, make sure you also
installed an interface package such as <emphasis>vlc-gtk</emphasis>
or <emphasis>vlc-qt</emphasis>. If you installed from source, make
sure the development package for gtk 1.2 or qt is correctly installed
(often <emphasis>gtk-dev</emphasis>, <emphasis>gtk-devel</emphasis> or
<emphasis>libgtk1.2-dev</emphasis>) and recompile.

</para></answer></qandaentry>

<qandaentry>

<question><para>Clicking on "<emphasis>disc</emphasis>" in the interface
does not do anything</para></question>

<answer><para>Wait a few seconds. Key discovering can take much time on
some discs. If it still does not work, you can have a more verbose
output using <command>vlc -vvvvv</command>. Here are a few things to
check for:</para>

<itemizedlist>

<listitem><para>Did you install the libdvdcss package?</para></listitem>

<listitem><para>Do you have write access to your DVD device?
For instance, under Unix, <command>chmod 666 /dev/hdc</command>
</para></listitem>

<listitem><para>Under Unix, does your kernel log contain line about your
DVD device?</para></listitem>

<listitem><para>Under Unix, do you have a link from <filename>/dev/dvd</filename> to your real DVD device? For instance:</para>

</itemizedlist>

</answer></qandaentry>

<qandaentry>

<question><para>The video runs but the picture is distorted</para></question>

<answer><para>There is probably a problem with the output layer. There
are several ways of troubleshooting it. First, try with another output
plugin, for instance:</para>

<screen>
<prompt>% </prompt><userinput>vlc --vout sdl</userinput>
<prompt>% </prompt><userinput>vlc --vout x11</userinput>
</screen>

<para>Second, change your screen depth and/or definition. It quite
often helps. Lastly, if running Unix, have a look at your XFree86 video
driver (nVidia for instance releases optimized drivers for its boards).
</para></answer></qandaentry>

<qandaentry>

<question><para>Video is choppy</para></question>

<answer><para>Your system is too slow to decode all pictures. It might
be that your CPU basically is not fast enough. It can also be that the
subsystem is misconfigured/misdriven, this happens for example under
Redhat Linux. Here are some elements to improve speed: </para>

</para></answer></qandaentry>

<qandaentry>

<question><para>Audio and video are out of sync</para></question>

<answer><para>This is not normal. Try using another output plugin (for
instance <command>--aout dsp</command>), kill <emphasis>esd</emphasis>
or <emphasis>artsd</emphasis> if they are running. This is a known
problem and is being investigated.

<question><para>I do not have access to the GUI anymore</para></question>

<answer><para>If you change the default interface module in the
preferences menu to a non GUI module (ie. to a command line interface)
and then save the configuration, the only way to get VLC to show a GUI
again is to run it directly from the command line.</para>

<para>For instance on Windows, you need to open a Command Line
console, go to the directory where you installed VLC (usually
<filename>C:\Program Files\VideoLAN\VideoLAN Client</filename>) and then
type <command>vlc --intf win32</command> You will then be able to modify
the configuration again and save it.

<question><para>I have just upgraded to VLC 0.4.5, and now I do not have
any sound with the streams coming from the VLS!</para></question>

<answer><para>This is a known problem. VLC 0.4.5 and later are now
compliant to general usage regarding A/52 sound, and the new behavior
is incompatible with the previous one. VLS version 0.4.0 and later now
fixes this problem. If, for any reason, you wish to keep VLS 0.3.3, you
can still read those streams by launching VLC (0.4.5 or later) with
<command>--vls-backwards-compat</command>.

</para></answer></qandaentry>

<qandaentry>

<question><para>NO VIDEO!! or NO AUDIO!!</para></question>

<answer><para>DON'T PANIC! Use the verbose mode of VLC to search the
problem, you may either set the verbosity option in the interface
preferences or use the <command>-vvvv</command> command line switch to
increase the number of report/error messages given by VLC. If you are
not using a terminal, use the Messages window in the View menu.

<question><para>May I redistribute VLC?</para></question>

<answer><para>You may distribute an original or modified version of a
VideoLAN software as long as you comply with its license terms. It is
the GNU General Public License Version 2 (referred herein as GPL), and
it is in the file named COPYING in our products. The easiest way to
conform to the GPL is to accompany the product you want to distribute
with its sources. For example, if you plan to distribute the 0.4.6
binary version you should include: </para>

<programlisting>
   http://www.videolan.org/pub/videolan/vlc/0.4.6/vlc-0.4.6.tar.gz
   http://www.videolan.org/pub/videolan/vlc/0.4.6/contrib/
</programlisting>

<para>You do not need to bother explaining where the sources are, but
the sources have to share the same media as the products.</para>

<para>They are other ways to comply with the GPL, but this should be the
simplest because it does not rely on a contract.</para>

<para>There is one additional issue you need to take care of. The VLC
binary from our website can also read encrypted DVDs with the help of
the <emphasis>libdvdcss</emphasis> library. Its use is controversial in
a few countries such as the United States because of a law called the
DMCA. If you are unsure about the legality of using and distributing
this library in your country, please consult your lawyer.

<question><para>Why are your mailing-lists and your website in
english?</para></question>

<answer><para>VideoLAN's developers come from all around the world and
english is the only language they can use to communicate together.
Although great care is given to the translation of VLC in various
languages, maintaining translations of our documentation and website
costs too much more time than we can afford.
