   * Updated changelog.

2001-12-31 Monday 04:53  sam

   * Fixed detection of the esd plugin.
   * Fixed the ts plugin's input type detection.
   * Fixed the BadCursor error in the x11 and xvideo plugins. For real this
     time (unlike my 2001/08/03 fix :p).
   * Made the wall filter work a bit better. It now spawns a 3x2 mosaic,
     but this will eventually be configurable, à la `--filter wall:3x3'.

2001-12-31 Monday 03:59  sam

   * Added a missing call to DecoderError() in mpeg_adec.c.
   * Fixed a segfault in the aRts plugin.

 *Some fixes for dvdread plugin.

 It compiles but doesn't work yet.

2001-12-30 Sunday 07:09  sam

 Some heavy changes today:
   * Removed duplicate function checks from configure.in.
   * Added extra magic to Makefile.modules so that the module Makefiles
     are now ridiculously simple. And I mean *simple*. Check it! This will
     make a possible switch to full autoconf/automake a lot easier.
   * Added the vlc version name to the plugin symbols, to be sure we only load
     plugins with the same version number. A nasty consequence is that you
     need to rebuild your tree after midnight if you are using a CVS tree :-)
   * Got rid of modules_export.h by #defining exported functions in the same
     header as their prototype.
   * Added modules_inner.h and other commonly used .h files to common.h so
     there are less and less files to include, and renamed common.h to
     <videolan/vlc.h>.
   * First modifications to the module handling system towards my ultimate
     goal to get rid of the *_Probe functions. Got rid of TestMethod and
     TestCPU, as well as src/misc/tests.c.
   * Wrote the chroma plugin handling functions. No YUV functions have been
     ported yet because it'ls a lot of work, but the core system works, I
     tried it with a naive yv12->rgb16 plugin (which will disappear when the
     real functions are ready).
   * Made a lot of functions in dvd_summary.c one-liners to avoid wasting
     too many output lines.
   * Fixed a segfault in input_dvd.c:DVDInit.
   * Added a fixfiles.sh script in plugins/gtk to be run after Glade has
     generated its C files.
   * Did some work on the KDE interface to make it suck a bit less. It still
     segfaults, but at least it runs and it looks less ugly.
   * RGB SDL rendering works again, though in 16bpp only.
   * Made plugins/vcd/linux_cdrom_tools.c independent of any vlc structure
     so that it'll be easily put in a library. Maybe libdvdcss?
   * Fixed VCD date display.
   * Merged vout_xvideo.c, vout_x11.c and vout_common.c into xcommon.c.
   * Wrote non-Shm XVideo output.
   * Made X11 output work again. Still pretty unstable, only works for 16bpp.
   * Additional french translation in po/fr.po. Any taker for the rest?
   * Fixed a segfault in video_output.c when the allocated pictures were
     not direct buffers.
   * If $DISPLAY isn't set, don't try to run the Gtk+ interface.
   * Replaced 48x48 .xpm images with 32x32 ones to conform to Debian policy
     (Closes Debian bug #126939).
   * Removed the automatic ./configure launch when running `make all' for
     the first time.

 Stuff currently more broken than it ought to be:
   * The wall filter. Being fixed.
   * x11 and sdl plugins for depth != 16bpp.
   * Software YUV.
   * gvlc, gnome-vlc, kvlc shortcuts. Use --intf instead for the moment.

2001-12-30 Sunday 06:31  sam

   * Duh. Reverted Håkan's patch. Adding the same target three times isn't
     a good idea.

2001-12-30 Sunday 05:46  sam

   * Forgot a file in my last commit.

2001-12-30 Sunday 05:38  sam

   * Put ErrorThread() in input_ext-dec.h because it was the same function
     in all decoders. Called it DecoderError() instead.
   * All decoders enter DecoderError() in case of error, even if they
     haven't allocated all their data. This prevents the input from getting
     stuck if a decoder has failed its initialization.
   * Namespace fixes through the decoder files.

2001-12-30 Sunday 04:26  sam

   * Fixed a segfault at EOF in input_es.c and input_ts.c (when i_read == 0).
   * Improved error recovery and avoided memleaks in the various input plugins.
   * Fixed a deadloop inserted by someone else into input_vcd.c :-)

2001-12-29 Saturday 23:35  sam

   * Backported lool's fix for the Gtk+ playlist crash.
   * If $DISPLAY isn't set, don't try to run the Gtk+ interface.

 fixed a segfault in vcd input (thank you Sam)

2001-12-19 Wednesday 03:50  sam

   * Initialize SDL before opening the SDL audio output.
   * Prevent two SDL video outputs or audio outputs to be spawned at the
     same time to avoid ugly crashes.
   * The SDL plugin now says whether we are using software or hardware YUV
     in its window title.
   * We now stop at the first ':' when looking for a module name, to easily
     pass information to the modules. Possible example: --vout sdl:software,
     implementation of such an option is left as an exercise.
   * Merged filter_bob and filter_bob422 into filter_bob. Use --filter bob
     to deinterlace 422 into 420 as well.
   * Factorized code common to most filters and the video output, optimized
     a few filters by aligning data and reading 64 bits at a time.
   * Two new absolutely useless, CPU-eating, resource-wasting, but fun
     filters: enjoy `transform', which performs flips and 90° rotations, and
     `distort', which performs animated image effects (currently only a naive
     sine wave is implemented). Usage examples:
        --filter transform:hflip
        --filter transform:vflip
        --filter transform:90
        --filter transform:180
        --filter transform:270
        --filter distort:wave

2001-12-17 Monday 05:33  sam

   * Pathetic attempt at a 4:2:2 renderer and deinterlacer, combining the
     most awful line dropping techniques of both BOB and 422 to 420
     downscaling. Don't worry, it should only survive for a couple of days.

2001-12-16 Sunday 16:18  sam

   * Filter plugins. Not very polished (please don't look at how the dates are
     calculated!), but worth a try. Use the following flags:
      "--filter invert" for inverse video
      "--filter bob" for BOB deinterlacing
   * Fixed a potential segfault if the subtitle stream was encountered
     before the video stream.

   * If you want to test vlc, please use the v0_2_92_branch branch.

   * Stuff currently working:
      - direct to YUV buffer decoding
      - non-ugly subtitle blending
      - XVideo and SDL video output

   * Stuff currently utterly broken:
      - aspect ratio
      - software rendering (ie, all other video output plugins)

   * Additional misc changes:
      - Renamed spu_dec to spudec and mad_adec to mad to stay coherent with
        other plugins. Also, renamed mpeg to mpeg_system.
      - Added jobi to the AUTHORS file.

      for syncronizing acces to the p_vout->p_sys structure.
      The p_vout->change_lock mutex is used for syncronization now. (and
      should make synronization work)

     #define off64_t off_t
     ....
     #endif
     to dvdread.c

  *) Fixed stupid bug in vout_macos.x. On startup, it would
     try to free a non-existant QuickTime Sequence. This could be
     the reasons for (some?) of the crashes at startup.

  * Big clean-up to allow compiling every module as plugins.
  * Added bytes_swap.h to provide ntoh() and htol() on Win32. With this
      change we don't have to link winsock2 with every plugin anymore. This
      should also give us a slight speed increase.
  * Added #define WIN32_LEAN_AND_MEAN in threads.h to speed-up compilation
      on Win32.
  * Modified ac_downmix_3dn and sse so they compile with the latest gcc for
      Win32.

 (PS: the dvdread plugin doesn't compile yet on Win32)

2001-11-25 Sunday 05:04  stef

 Support for libdvdread.

 Libdvdread files are in extras/libdvdread. They have not been changed from
 those of libdvdread 0.9.2. The changes are in the subdirectory videolan.
 They basically consist of a new function in the API that does a readv()
 instead fo a read().

 The library is statically linked with libdvdcss from extras/libdvdcss, and
 the whole is statically linked with the plugin dvdread. Dvdread can only be
 compiled as a builtin module for the time being, I think (which means I
 haven't tried to compile it as a plugin).

 Basically, input_dvdread.c is a copy and paste from input_dvd.c with a few
 changes to use libdvdread calls. It is still in very alpha stage, but it
 should offer the same features as the current DVD input.

 It can be called with either the syntax: "dvdread:/dev/dvd"
 or "--input dvdread /dev/dvd". The command line switches (-t, -T, -c, -u)
 should work too.

2001-11-25 Sunday 01:26  sam

   * Added "Video" menu hint to debian/*menu (Closes Debian bug #121036).

2001-11-23 Friday 18:47  massiot

 Major rewrite of the network layer. The following syntax ARE NO LONGER
 SUPPORTED :
 ts:toto:1234/meuh
 --server toto --broadcast meuh --port 1234

 The only supported syntax is :
 udp[stream]:[//][serveraddr:[serverport]][@[bindaddr][:bindport]]
 example : udpstream:toto@meuh:toto

 In most cases, simply passing "udpstream:" should work, since it enables
 unicast and broadcast reception on port 1234 from any server. Other
 options are only used for fine tuning and multicast.

 TODO :
 * The GTK interface is broken (glade knowledge wanted !)
 * Test this on all supported platforms (and fix them :)
 [this won't work with current channel servers - fix needed]

2001-11-21 Wednesday 22:33  jlj

 -fixed a bug in libdvdcss: the key wasn't searched when it had to.

 dvdcss_seek : searches a new title key when
 	-the flag is DVDCSS_SEEK_KEY,
 	-the flag is DVDCSS_SEEK_MPEG, only if method is not "title".

 dvdcss_seek with DVDCSS_SEEK_KEY flags does actually the same things as
 dvdcss_title (which might eventually be removed).

 Thus, the flag DVDCSS_SEEK_KEY (formerly DVDCSS_SEEK_INI) could not be
 removed (sorry sam, I've mistaken you by forgetting that)

 The default file-translation mode was not being set under win32.
 In other words, file playback in 0.2.91 does not work. For de-

 problems under previous windows versions. I noticed it was
 originally 0ms, but later changed to 1ms...

 Reverted one change from my previous commit: when using title cracking
 method in libdvdcss, the key is only checked at title start, not before each
 chapter.

 The behaviour when we have decrypted the disc key is to check the key before
 each seek (although I'm still fighting against a bug).

2001-10-14 Sunday 03:26  stef

 Use of an environment variable to choose libdvdcss method.

2001-10-13 Saturday 15:34  stef

 New features for libdvdcss: we have three ways now to decode a title key.

 1) Crack the title key (the method that was here before). The only change
 here is that we search the key for the exact chapter we are seeking with
 DVDSetArea (in case the key has changed within a title). It is maybe not a
 good idea.

 2) Crack the disc key, which allows us to decode instantly all title keys.
 I've used an algorithm from Frank Stevenson ; it eats much memory (64MB),
 and takes about 15 s at launch time.

 3) Decode the disc key with player keys (libcss method). However, you need
 licensed player keys at build time for that to work.

 To choose between libdvdcss methods, a command line options is supplied:

         vlc --dvdcss <method> where method is one of title, disc, key.

 Note that all these changes only work with linux now, since we have to add a
 specific ioctl to read title key. I hope that I haven't broken too many things.

 The vlc now compiles when cross-compiling with Mingw32. It segfaults
 while browsing plugins (modules.o, it seems).

 Oh, btw, stats won't work under win32, since <sys/times.h> and the
 function times don't seem to exist.

 Sam, may I speak with you tomorrow about modules.c ?

2001-10-03 Wednesday 02:53  xav

 Modified configure.in to allow cross-compiling with Mingw32.
 Quick and ugly, i'm gonna find a better way to do it.

2001-10-03 Wednesday 02:20  tcastley

 Updated to compile on BeOS.

2001-10-03 Wednesday 02:19  tcastley

 Changes to ensure the BeOS compile still works.

2001-10-02 Tuesday 17:09  sam

   * Added HTTP virtualhost support in the HTTP input.
   * Enabled mouse clicks in the GGI plugin.
   * Minor Makefile alteration.

   <mathias@research.att.com>.

2001-10-02 Tuesday 16:46  massiot

 * Cleaned up sam's mess with input's pf_open and pf_close (not completely) ;
 * With -vvv modules now show up their scores ;

 This afternoon I have been a little bored, so the feature of the day is :
 * HTTP input support.

 You can test it with :
 ./vlc http://mysite.com:80/mystream.mpg
 It doesn't implement any kind of buffering, so make sure you have enough
 bandwidth, otherwise you'll just get nothing.

 It is compatible with HTTP proxy, just set http_proxy :
 export http_proxy="http://proxy.mycompany.com:3128/"

 Enjoy !

2001-10-02 Tuesday 13:34  massiot

 * Borrowed Mandrakesoft's vlc.spec and libdvdcss.spec ;
 * New configure option --with-tuning=[arch], extending --enable-pentiumpro ;
 for Pentium, use --with-tuning=pentium, for PowerPC 604 use --with-tuning=604,
 and so on.

2001-10-01 Monday 16:44  massiot

 Dramatically improve compilation time, with a negligible performance
 tradeoff.

2001-10-01 Monday 16:18  massiot

 Error checks in debug mode : pthread ERRORCHECK_MUTEX and MALLOC_CHECK_=2.

2001-10-01 Monday 10:27  massiot

 "added support for an unusual construct at the start of some
 slices", says walken :-).

2001-09-30 Sunday 20:25  bozo

 Small optimisation of my previous commit.

2001-09-30 Sunday 01:26  stef

 . in spdif ac3 in selected by default

2001-09-30 Sunday 01:05  stef

 . video output grows to respect acpect ratio instead of shrinking (not
 in x11 because it takes cpu to resize a picture)

 . disable dpms in xvideo

2001-09-30 Sunday 00:33  stef

 .better handling of the buffer of the sound driver to try to remove
  sratches in spdif.

 Thanx to bozo for his help :)

2001-09-29 Saturday 14:52  bozo

 Fix bad dates in ac3 spdif "decoder" (playing with the bit stream is very
 funny).
 Thanks to Stef for his ideas, Meuuh for his bit stream, and Sam for his
 trolls :)

2001-09-09 Sunday 13:43  sam

  Changes to vlc:

   * Fixed arch-dependant build dependencies (Closes Debian bug #109722).
   * Minor changes to the (non-working) ncurses interface.

  Changes to libdvdcss (courtesy of Håkan Hjort <d95hjort@dtek.chalmers.se>):

   * If we see 3000 unencrypted blocks assume that the title is unencrypted.
   * If we have not seen any encrypted block and then discover that the block
     just read is not a valid block of an MPEG2 Program stream, assume that the
     title is unencrypted.
   * Empty keys (for unscrambled sectors) are now cached as well.
   * We try to decrypt the file even if DVD ioctls are not available.

2001-09-06 Thursday 18:21  henri

 (e.g. have problems with this) ;
 * Added warning messages.

2001-08-24 Friday 10:51  sam

   * Fixed build dependencies for architectures not supporting libasound2
     (Closes Debian bug #109722).

2001-08-24 Friday 09:20  massiot

 Install doesn't explode if libdvdcss hasn't been compiled.

2001-08-23 Thursday 15:39  sam

   * Attempt to fix the SDL detection under *BSD.

2001-08-23 Thursday 13:24  massiot

 Removed /usr/local/include, because it is unsafe in a cross-compilation
 environment. If you have problems with this, tell me and we'll find an
 alternate solution.

2001-08-23 Thursday 10:08  massiot

 Very small enhancements.

2001-08-22 Wednesday 21:18  gbazin

 (buggy) web streaming.

2001-08-22 Wednesday 17:21  massiot

 * Totally rewrote the video decoder (inspired by walken's mpeg2dec), implying :
 - performance boost ;
 - fixed the "Dual Prime Arithmetic" bug ;
 - 3DNow! motion compensation module ;
 * BTW, fixed numerous bugs ;
 * AC3dec statistics do not show up with --enable-stats, because I doubt
 they're understandable by a normal human being, and they pollute the output.

2001-08-22 Wednesday 15:16  sam

   * Grmbl. Forgot to update the libdvdcss changelog.

2001-08-22 Wednesday 14:23  sam

   * Split ChangeLog into ChangeLog and ChangeLog.libdvdcss.
   * Added --xvadaptor flag to select the XVideo adaptor to use.
   * Everything is ready for the 0.2.83 release.

2001-08-20 Monday 01:03  jlj

   * Switched QNX audio output to block mode as stream mode is no
     longer supported under the latest QNX release.

2001-08-19 Sunday 23:35  sam

   * Added support in ./configure for the cprof profiler.
   * Activated -D_FILE_OFFSET_BITS=64 -D__USE_UNIX98 on all platforms, fixes
     issues under Solaris and QNX.
   * Additional checks for SSE-specific (non-MMXEXT) instructions, as
     reported in <20010817114220.A23480@slartibartfast.angrypacket.com>.

2001-08-17 Friday 01:26  jlj

   * Overlay now works under latest QNX release.

   * Fixed yesterday's pthread detection fix.

2001-08-14 Tuesday 12:09  tcastley

 Rewritten vout for BeOS.  Now does not support overlay however code is simpler
 and easier to implement overlay and DirectWindow.

2001-08-14 Tuesday 04:52  sam

   * GNU/Hurd configuration and compilation fixes.

2001-08-14 Tuesday 00:00  sam

   * Fixed a crash in subtitle rendering.
   * Activated old crappy subtitle rendering in overlay mode (ugly but
     probably better than having no subtitles at all).

2001-08-13 Monday 12:24  sam

   * Added missing debian files I forgot to add a long time ago.
   * Fixed libglide2/libglide3 inconsistency in debian/control.

2001-08-10 Friday 17:53  sam

   * Another stupid typo (hope I got it right this time :p).

2001-08-10 Friday 17:43  sam

   * Another mistake in the BSD/OS configuration process.

2001-08-10 Friday 17:14  massiot

   * Added BSD/OS libdvd by Steven M. Schultz <sms@TO.GD-ES.COM> in
     extras/BSDI_dvdioctl after he suggested it. License is GPL.
   * ./configure now checks for an installed libdvd under BSD/OS and
     falls back to ours if not found.
   * Fixed harmless typos in yesterday's Solaris libdvd patches.
   * Bumped libdvdcss version number up to 0.0.3 ; release will probably
     follow once the BSDI changes have been tested.

2001-08-09 Thursday 20:16  jlj

 Fixed a memory leak in the ifo parser and input_EndStream

2001-08-09 Thursday 08:20  sam

   * Fixed a bug in the gtk interface which caused vlc to go amok after
     having met a zero-sized area.
   * Found out how to type 'å' in vim :-)
   * Added missing bloat to modules_export.h.
   * 'snapshot*' rules do not depend on 'clean', and don't use /tmp anymore.
   * Added vlc:loop playlist command to go back at the beginning.
     Usage: vlc file1.mpeg file2.mpeg ... fileN.mpeg vlc:loop
     This change isn't very elegant but there are already bugs in the
     playlist handling, I'll try to polish it once the playlist is fixed.

2001-08-08 Wednesday 02:48  sam

   * Solaris DVD decryption support by H}kan Hjort <d95hjort@dtek.chalmers.se>.

2001-08-07 Tuesday 10:54  sam

   * Updated version number to 0.2.82.
   * Updated ChangeLog.
   * Fixed a typo in Makefile.dep.

2001-08-07 Tuesday 02:48  sam

   * Got Makefile to launch ./configure almost properly. $(MAKECMDGOALS) rules !
   * Various debian scripts fixes.
   * Added -lmsvcrt40 to the win32 flags for proper execution under Wine.
   * Fixed broken soname setting under Solaris (and OS X, sort of).
   * Made the illegal instruction report more explicit.
   * BSD/OS 4.3beta1 fixes by Steven M. Schultz <sms@TO.GD-ES.COM>.

2001-08-06 Monday 20:45  gbazin

 * Fixed the sdl video output plugin that I broke 2 days ago.

2001-08-06 Monday 13:46  sam

   * libdvdcss* packages are now a bit more policy-compliant.

2001-08-06 Monday 13:27  sam

   * Added a dummy libdvdcss so that the DVD plugin can be used without
     libdvdcss. It will try to dlopen() libdvdcss at runtime, though,
     and will use the dummy functions only if it couldn't find a valid
     libdvdcss. This is probably only useful to package maintainers.

   * Tidied the snapshot-* Makefile rules.
   * Tidied the modules Makefiles.
   * Removed useless stuff in the debian/ directory.
   * Removed the "make all" kludge in the Makefile.opts rule. I hope this
     patch is harmless on all systems.

2001-08-06 Monday 13:13  sam

   * Made the remote command plugin usable even with no stream.
   * Fixed a deadlock in the remote command plugin.
   * Fixed a deadlock in the SPU decoder.

 * Minor bug fix to aout_directx.c

2001-08-05 Sunday 15:32  gbazin

 * Big rewrite of the DirectX audio plugin. The audio output is now (almost)
     perfect on Win32.
 * Fixed a bug in ac3dec_CreateThread() in ac3_decoder_thread.
 * On Win32, open() will now open files in binary mode by default.
 * A few minor changes to vout_xvideo.c

2001-08-03 Friday 18:03  gbazin

 Oops, forgot to commit this file.

2001-08-03 Friday 16:04  gbazin

 * Fixed a segfault in yuv_End() in video_yuvmmx.c
 * Fixed the "Gdk-ERROR **: BadCursor" bug in the x11 and xvideo plugins
 * Fixed a segfault in SetBufferPicture() in video_output.c. This segfault
     only happened with the xvideo plugin because this one is not using
     SetBuffers().

 PS: The last fix broke the overlay output of SDL (black screen) I will
   investigate this later on.

2001-07-31 Tuesday 21:13  gbazin

 * Fixed a segfault in PSEnd in input_ps.c
 * The video decoder thread is now also reniced to a lower priority on
   Win32 (as in the linux version). This slightly increases the responsiveness of vlc.

2001-07-30 Monday 18:56  gbazin

 * Fixed a Win32 bug in libdvdcss. This bug was appearing on title change.
 * Modified input_dvd so you can now go directly to the selected chapter
   when you change the title.
 * Implemented the Probe function in the Xvideo plugin. Xvideo is now the
   default video output plugin when it is supported.

2001-07-30 Monday 14:13  massiot

 * Now use SDL_CFLAGS for searching SDL/SDL.h.

2001-07-30 Monday 13:57  massiot

 * Changed the order of evaluation of sdl-config and sdl11-config ;
 * Finally fixed SDL*/SDL.h check ;

2001-07-30 Monday 00:53  sam

   * VC++/Intel compiler fixes by Jon Lech Johansen <jon-vl@nanocrew.net>.

2001-07-29 Sunday 22:54  sam

   * Removed duplicate checks in configure.in.
   * Fixed a typo in vlc.spec.

2001-07-28 Saturday 02:17  sam

   * Added a make uninstall rule.

2001-07-27 Friday 14:43  sam

   * Updated version numbers for imminent release.
   * Fixed the --with-dvdcss flag:
      o --with-dvdcss - build libdvdcss, link statically (also default behaviour)
      o --with-dvdcss=local-static - build libdvdcss, link statically
      o --with-dvdcss=local-shared - build libdvdcss, link dynamically
      o --with-dvdcss=/foo/bar - don't build libdvdcss, use libdvdcss in /foo/bar
   * Fixed an omission in the dvdcss.h header.

2001-07-27 Friday 09:17  massiot

 Disabled Dual Prime Arithmetic message for the release :-p.

2001-07-27 Friday 01:19  bozo

 Fix another little silly thing.

2001-07-27 Friday 01:05  sam

   * Changed libdvdcss API to force binary incompatibility. Yeah, this is
     evil, but if we don't do it now we'll have to do it when more people
     are using it.
   * Fixed minor libdvdcss stuff such as the soname and compilation flags.
   * New --with-dvdcss flag.
     Explanation:
      o default: build libdvdcss, statically link vlc against it.
      o --with-dvdcss=no: build libdvdcss, dynamically link vlc against it.
      o --with-dvdcss=yes: don't build libdvdcss, use already installed one.
      o --with-dvdcss=/foo: don't build libdvdcss, use libdvdcss from /foo/*.
     (this looks a bit strange to me, I'll find better flag settings)

2001-07-27 Friday 00:49  bozo

 Fix a bug in aout spdif with dolby stereo (use of obsolete PTS).

 Bozo and Stef : the dream team of bozos. Stef you're gonna die (dunga).

  * Fixed _win32_dvdcss_aread to work around the WinASPI32 64kb transfer
    size restriction.
  * New and theoretically better Win32 pthread implementation which fixes a
    problem I was having when changing title on a DVD (netlist related).
    vlc_cond_multicast may or may not work.
  * Fixed the "quit" event handling in directx/vout_events.c.
  * dvd_ifo.c now takes into account error messages from UDFFindFile.
  * Temporarily disabled aout_Probe() in aout_SDL (this function
    is creating an awful lot of problems - libSDL bug ).

2001-07-25 Wednesday 03:53  sam

   * Updated ChangeLog.

2001-07-25 Wednesday 03:12  sam

   * ncurses compilation fix by Michael Mondragon <mammon@lokmail.net>.

2001-07-25 Wednesday 00:23  sam

   * libdvdcss segfault fixes, at last!
      (I really wonder how it could have worked before :)

2001-07-24 Tuesday 12:03  massiot

 Tuned constants, since it seems to make people happy.

2001-07-24 Tuesday 11:16  xav

 Removed the changes made ; vlc should compile when following the
 instructions in INSTALL-win32.

2001-07-24 Tuesday 09:40  xav

 Quick and ugly hack in the makefile to allow vlc_win32 to compile when
 getting it directly from the CVS. As a result, the vlc_win32 program
 doesn't have an icon any more. Too bad.

2001-07-20 Friday 16:20  massiot

2001-07-18 Wednesday 15:21  massiot

 A BIG kludge for the calculation of mux_rate, so that times displayed in
 the scroll bar are now correct for MPEG-2 streams. There is probably a
 better way to do it, but I haven't found in months.

2001-07-18 Wednesday 14:21  massiot

 * Rewrote the video decoder to take advantage of several processors (SMP mode) ;
 * Fixed a bug in the video decoder initialization :-p ;
 * Added --smp option and several hooks in src/input/input_ext-intf.c ;
 * Grayscale mode now turns off chroma IDCT.

2001-07-17 Tuesday 09:48  massiot

 Cleaned up include/. Unnecessary headers are no longer under include/, but
 under src/. (eat that)

2001-07-16 Monday 22:00  gbazin

 Added intf_DbgMsg and intf_DbgMsgImm symbols to modules_export.h

     should have prevented the Win9x dvd input from working.
 - Moved the "if(Win2k)" out of the loop in _win32_dvdcss_readv.

 - Put a readv() function in input_iovec.h, the input_es now compiles.
 - Modified input_ts to use this function.

 - Fixed an initialisation bug in vout_directx.c
 - Right clicking on the mouse now displays the navigation menu.

 PS: If someone is willing to test the DVD input on Win95/98/Me I will
     upload an up to date binary package.

 * Should fix buggy sound due to 44100-48000 Hz conversions

2001-07-11 Wednesday 14:26  gbazin

 DirectX plugin changes:
 - The Win32 GetMessage function has been isolated in a thread. This has
     been done because this function can block the thread. Thanks to this
     change, you can now move your window without any video and audio
     interruption.
 - Splitted the events handling code into a separate file.
 - Fixed the bug associated with the window dragging option in the
     diplay properties.

   * libdvdcss enhancements by Billy Biggs <vektor@dumbterm.net>. This breaks
     vlc's DVD input (looks like decoders are expecting data too early and
     DVD input can't cope with it due to decryption). Needs to be investigated.
   * Plugins are now compiled in plugins/* and libraries in lib/*.
   * The KDE UI compiles again but does not work yet.
   * ALSA plugin message corrections.
   * Calculation modules can now be calledwith a shorter name
     (eg. '--downmix mmx' instead of '--downmix downmixmmx').
   * Fixed insane verbosity of the SDL plugin.

2001-07-10 Tuesday 06:07  gbazin

 - Fixed the segfault in vout_UnloadFont
 - DestroyThread in video_output doesn't call pf_destroy if pf_create has
     failed previously.
 - The Xvideo plugin now closes the video window when it XVideoGetPort
     fails in vout_Create.

 Win32 changes only:

  - defined off_t as a long long. This allows DVD navigation to work.
    This change is to be implemented on a compiler by compiler basis. For
    now, it works on mingw32 (tested) and should work on MSVC (not tested).

  - Implemented a quick and dirty hack in intf_msg.c to be able to display
    long long integers with printf on Win32. This change is also necessary
    to avoid segfaults when debug is enabled in vlc on Win32.

  - few minor changes in the directx plugins.

  - defined snprintf in common.h and removed a few #ifdef WIN32

2001-07-07 Saturday 21:10  gbazin

 - Removed unecessary translations in the win32 code from block offsets to
     byte offsets. This was overflowing some variables.
 - Reduced the complexity of the Win9x ASPI functions because we only need
     to handle DVD drive access.
 - Win32 code now handles seeking in areas above 2.1 Go on DVDs.

2001-07-07 Saturday 17:45  sam

   * Probably fixed the "X eats more and more CPU" bug. Please test.
   * mingw32 cross-compilation issue fixed.

2001-07-06 Friday 08:43  sam

   * Small optimization in vpar_blocks.c, sparing a few memset() calls.
   * Additional error checking in vout_sdl.c.
   * Minor manpage fix, conforming to Debian policy version 3.5.5.0
     (Closes Debian bug #99561).

2001-07-01 Sunday 08:49  gbazin

 - Portablility fix: We now control the name to be used in the assembler
     code for a C function or variable.
     GCC for Win32 normally prepends an underscore to the name of a
     C function or variable, and the inline assembler code was using the
     name without the underscore so we had undefined symbols in some
     modules.
 - Reenabled all the accelerated modules on Win32.

2001-06-29 Friday 11:34  stef

 Bugfix for chapters change in DVD.

2001-06-28 Thursday 22:12  gbazin

 - a few bug fixes for the directx plugin.
 - removed the custom usleep function for win32 as we don't really need
     this accuracy, and it was eating cpu resources.

2001-06-27 Wednesday 09:53  massiot

 Elementary Stream input plugin (use it with --input es). Only works with
 video streams at the moment.

2001-06-27 Wednesday 06:29  gbazin

 - Added command line option '--stdout <filename>' which redirects stdout
     and stderr to the specified file. This option should mainly be useful
     on Win32.
 - On Win32, vlc now has an icon associated to the .exe file, and is a full
     GUI application (you don't have this annoying dos command box anymore)
 - Added INSTALL-win32.txt for specific details to the Win32 port.

 I've tested these changes on Win32 and Linux, let's hope I didn't break
   vlc for other platforms.

   * Added gprof profiling support with --enable-profiling.

     It works at last! configure with --enable-profiling, build, run
  vlc (you may want to add --noaudio, it currently segfaults with sound
  here) and launch "gprof vlc" when finished.

     To make gprof work with multithreaded programs, one needs to set the
  internal ITIMER_PROF timer for each new thread launched. I did this
  through a wrapper in vlc_thread_create (see include/threads.h).

   * Another failed attempt at profiling vlc under Linux: ported the
     threads API to GNU Pth. Activate with --enable-pth. It doesn't seem to
     spawn new threads for me, maybe someone will have better luck.
   * Makefile optimizations.
   * Automatic build of libdvdcss if not found.

 *the position in the title is now resetted when we change title to
 prevent a title from being unavailable because we're stuck at the end

 *fixed a bug with 1-chapter-long title that displayed chapter 0.

 *added a _temporary_ field in p_main to know whether the audio stream is
 ac3 (ugly). It allows a vlc launched in spdif mode to play mpeg or lpcm
 audio.

 *cleaned the title property messages to get rid of the ugly stars.

   * Applied old FreeBSD patch for dvd input by German Tischler.
   * Found what was causing the slowdowns: a namespace collision. Put all
     plugins into builtins again.

2001-06-07 Thursday 01:10  sam

   * Put most builtins in plugins again due to performances issues (more
     about this in a forthcoming post here).
   * Fixed the painfully slow build process (at last!).
   * Moved the null plugin together with the dummy one.
   * Added new dummy input plugin.

    More on the dummy input plugin: we'll use it to insert commands in
   the playlist. Currently implemented are the "quit" and "pause" functions,
   here are examples on how they are used:

     vlc file.mpeg vlc:quit                # exit after file.mpeg has been read.

     vlc file1.mpeg vlc:pause:3 file2.mpeg # pause 3 seconds before playing
                                           # the next file.

    From now we can more efficiently benchmark vlc. For instance, to test
   the video output changes I am doing, I use such a command:

     time vlc -I dummy --noaudio file.mpeg vlc:quit

    Future extentions might include more interesting stuff like "switch
   to full screen", "repeat next file 3 times", "switch to SDL video
   output"...

   * Fixed the BeOS compile typo.
   * The ALSA plugin is back.
   * A gift for Gildas: plugins don't rely on backlinking any more. The
     drawback is the dirty magic in include/modules_export.h which has to
     be included whenever a module needs one of the functions in it. But
      a) we should less and less rely on those functions
      b) no plugin code modification was needed

    The BeOS and MacOS X modules may be broken when compiled as plugins,
    I'll check this later when I can reboot under BeOS.

   * Forgot a file for BeOS.

2001-05-25 Friday 04:23  sam

   OS X fixes:

   * Applied Eugenio's fix to the DVDioctl driver. I didn't test it, but
     it should not hang the kernel anymore.

   * Ported most dvd_ioctl.c functions to the DVDioctl driver: ReportAgid,
     ReportChallenge, ReportKey1, ReportASF, InvalidateAgid, SendChallenge,
     SendKey2. They should comply with the "Mt. Fuji Commands for Multimedia
     Devices" paper.

     Last remaining problem: ReadCopyright and ReadKey. The version of
  Darwin I have here only has reportKey() and sendKey() functions in
  the IODVDBlockStorageDevice class (pages 413 and 449 of the Mt. Fuji
  paper), but we also need the READ_STRUCTURE (page 357) which I couldn't
  find anywhere in the kernel headers. Either I missed it, or we'll have
  to wait for Apple to implement it (or maybe we can emulate this command
  with some other IOKit commands).

 *More cleanification in gtk interface: now to change the
 title/chapter/audio/spu/angle, we tell the input to do intead of doing
 it inside the interface. It results in fewer locks during the changes.

 *The dvd plugin reads again blocks of 32 sectors to gain speed since
 there are no more lock-ups during stream change. I've also created a new
 file that contain function to described video and audio streams with ifo
 datas.

 The changes are made only for gtk. We should update the other interfaces
 soon (beos at least).

 There is a memory corruption somewhere that make the vlc crash. I've no
 idea where to search.

 *added a b_stopped flag to interface playlist to have a stop function in
 interface plugins. As a consequence, the playlist no longer loops on end
 but wait for the user to press 'play' or to add another item (gtk/gnome
 interface). I think that other plugins are broken but it shouldn't be
 difficult to repair: just add a 'p_main->p_playlist->b_stopped = 0' in
 play functions and 'p_main->p_playlist->b_stopped = 1' when you have to
 stop.

 *Updated gtk interface so that it has the same features as gnome. I
 think I will merge the code so that we don't have to copy and paste each
 change. Only the .glade file would be different.

 window to go to specified time (not functionnal yet), and fixed some
 bugs.

 *moved b_fullscreen from p_vout->p_sys to p_vout and unified way of
 toggling fullscreen in sdl in x11/xvideo output (using p_vout->i_ch
 nges) so that an interface plugin can toogle fullscreen (implemented
 in gnome)

 *added p_input->stream.p_selected_area->i_tell in input TS so that the
 slider work with ts files ( however, the time counter doesn't since we
 have no mux_rate )

 *improved ac3 spdif output ( and made it work again :)). It uses a true
 blank frame now, and it allows to switch languages like a traditionnal

   work very slowly with many error messages. I'll try to have a look.

   * Fixed a remaining buffer overflow in the Gnome interface and applied
     the patches to the Gtk+ interface.

   * Fixed a segfault in the SPU decoder initialization.

2001-05-01 Tuesday 04:18  sam

   * Mandatory step for video output IV and the audio output quality
     fix: the output threads are now spawned when a decoder needs one,
     so it can decide the audio frequency or the video window size. Still
     under heavy construction, so don't get too excited at finding bugs
     in it yet.

     Note: this change broke the XVideo module, so I made its score much
     lower than before. I suspect xvideo.so had a bug before which only
     appears now. Other video output plugins may be broken as well, but
     again this might be due to old existing bugs showing their ugly head.

   * Fixed a few buffer overflows in the Gnome interface.
   * The module bank is now a global variable. The video output bank and
     the audio output bank might follow (when they exist).
   * Coding style and organization fixes to the spdif decoder.
   * autoconf and Makefile changes by Arnaud Gomes-do-Vale
     <arnaud@carrosse.frmug.org>.

 -slight modification in ClockManageRef: after a synchro reinit, we still
 do the mwait and re-init last-cr so that there no date irregularity.
 Such a thing is necessary for dvd playback at cell change ; however,
 Meuuh, could you look at that since you might think we should do
 otherwise.

 -turned the "bitsream callback discontinuity" message to debug.

 -removed modification of the title environnement variable in input dvd
 at title change since we no longer restart the input at title change.

 -new audio output using direct ac3 pass-through with some sound
 cards: it sends raw ac3 frames to an external ac3 decoder. It is very
 experimental yet, hasn't any synchro ... but it works well with my
 sblive and my dtt3500 speakers (note that you need a patched emu10k1
 driver for this to work).

 -bug fix in gnome intf thanks to Shane Harper.

 -bug fix in input_dvd for chapter change.

    the #ifdefs, but we won't tell a word about it for the moment. We don't
    really need windows users whining about bugs, do we ?)

 -corrected some bugs in gnome interface: language menu are now
 synchronized ; and menus have less chances to be changed when they're opened.

 -added basic angle support ; this is a first try. It works with my 2
 test-DVDs, but I'd like that people having DVDs with repeated scenes to
 test it. We can choose angle with command line option -u (don't ask me
 why :)

 -a cosmetic change in css decryption.

 Since config.h.in has changed, you have to re-run ./configure.

 Re-added the new packet allocation method in PS input, using packet caches.
 With warning level 1, you can see when a packet is allocated or freed; the
 goal is to never call 'malloc' nor 'free', except at the beginning of the
 stream.
 The size of the different caches can be adjusted in plugins/mpeg/input_ps.h.
 If 'free' is called too often, it means that a cache is too small, so try
 to increase its size.

   * Fixed XVideo plugin linking.

2001-04-15 Sunday 10:54  sam

   * Updated TODO list with Henri's Apr 6th post.
   * Built-in modules support almost finished.

     Now you can compile any module within vlc, even the Gnome, Qt, SDL
   and GGI modules at the same time, resulting in an awful extra fat
   vlc binary with gazillons of library dependecies.

     The only exception is that the Gnome and Gtk+ modules can't be
   compiled together into vlc. But you can have one compiled built-in
   and the other as a plugin.

     Another consequence is that libdl should no longer be needed under
   MacOS X. I'll check this as soon as possible.

2001-04-15 Sunday 04:46  sam

   * A few Makefile fixes for BeOS
   * XVideo patches by Shane Harper

2001-04-15 Sunday 04:19  sam

   * Beginning of the built-in modules support.

    A few words about the changes:

   - heavy Makefile butchery has taken place, each plugin now has its own
     Makefile. I know recursive make blablah harmful, but it was just so
     much easier to do this way.

   - Makefile.in has disappeared, we now generate Makefile.opts with
     the overall configuration options, and Makefile.modules which is
     specific to module compilation.

   - After ./configure has been run you may want to modify Makefile.opts
     to check which modules will be compiled built-in or as plugins.

   - Some modules cannot be compiled built-in right now because proper
     linkage doesn't work yet. We don't really care since they're the
     interface or video output modules. The most important stuff works
     (iDCT, motion, YUV, input).

   - It's perfectly valid to compile a module both as built-in and as a
     plugin. vlc will only load the built-in one, but I'll add an option
     to ignore built-in modules for testing purposes.

   - We *should* see a performance increase here. I didn't have much time
     to test it, but if anyone can confirm and perhaps give a rough
     estimate of how much we gain...

 TS input : only one audio & spu ES selected at a time
 Intf : ts streams in menu

2001-04-11 Wednesday 13:30  ej

 Updated & cleaned up intf_macosx.c and vout_macosx.c - added Open menu
 function support and a no-frills About box

 Created macosx_common.h in plugins/macosx/ to hold , well, common stuff
 (the way I see it, there is inherently a difficult separation of intf and
 vout on Mac OS, if anyone has suggestions I'm open)

 Cleaned up debug spew I left in modules.c and video_text.c

 Hacked main.c to disregard argv[1] when compiled for OSX & run as a full
 app (ie., double clicked and not launched from command line)... read the
 file for more details.  UGLY.

 Updated Makefile.in to make vlc.app by default on Mac OS X & Darwin, added

 This has not been finished yet (and it is not in gtk plugin then). And I
 think I will leave toolbar next/prev buttons for playlist and add
 button specifically for title change like for chapters.*

  * heavy butchering in the CSS and DVD ioctl code to put all architecture-

    extras/DVDioctl; to build it:

     % cd extras/DVDioctl

     % kextload build/DVDioctl.kext # note: kextload has to be run as root

    be aware that the license for the DVDioctl kernel extension is
    not GPL but APSL, because I borrowed some code from the Darwin kernel.

    Shane, I removed the static variables from your code because static
    is not thread-safe, and one can imagine having several video output
    windows launched at the same time. Also, I made your feature work
    in windowed mode as well, because people kept asking how to hide the
    mouse pointer.

    Also, if you want to work on the XVideo extension, you are welcome ;
    most of us are quite busy at the moment. Damien Lucas <nitrox@via.ecp.fr>
    had offered to work on it, but he seems to be a bit lost, so you may
    want to take over his job.

    As for the "zoom" feature, I suggest you wait until version 4 of the
    video output is done, it'll be easier to do then.

 Maybe solved the jump-at-will bug after random seek.

2001-03-15 Thursday 01:42  sam

   * Bug fixes and enhancements in the Gtk+/Gnome interfaces.

    o the slider should behave correctly and stop jumping here and
      there (this bug is _not_ related to Stef's similar bug)
    o added an "open network" menu (useless since the input doesn't
      handle it properly yet)
    o tried to reorganize gnome_callbacks.c and gtk_callbacks.c
    o stream date is now displayed instead of percentage
    o renamed gnome_sys.h to intf_gnome.h, and gtk_sys.h to intf_gtk.h

   * Changed documentation and package creation files.

    o added versioned conflicts/replaces to vlc-gtk (Closes Debian bug #88796)
    o removed useless or outdated documentation from doc/*
    o moved vlc.1 manpage from debian/vlc.1 to doc/vlc.1

   * Added basic Qt interface.

    o working features: slide bar, open file, toolbar, popup menu
    o added "qvlc" alias, equivalent to "vlc -I qt"
    o known issues : no "open disc" or "open network" menus yet
                     the IntfWindow class is never cleaned on destruction
                     the popup menu always pop at the middle of the screen

   * Misc fixes/updates.

    o renamed netutils.h functions from input_* to network_*
    o renamed *plst* files and functions to *playlist* (it was stupid
      from me to name them "plst")
    o made a few input error messages more meaningful
    o added -I, -A and -V short flags, corresponding to --intf, --audio
      and --video

     I got a lot of conflicts on this commit, lart me if I forgot a
   file or made old bugs reappear.

 "File|Open DVD" menu now refreshed each time menu selected rather than statically built at execute time.

2001-03-07 Wednesday 11:56  stef

 Port of the interface menus to gnome plugin.

 Note that two sorts of navigation menus are implemented : in the
 menubar, one menu for title and one the chapter in current title ; and
 in the popup, a cascaded version with all chapters for all menus.

 The same issues as gtk plugin apply.

2001-03-07 Wednesday 10:31  stef

 -Working menus for run-time audio/spu/title/chapter selection with gtk
 interface.

 It is a bit buggy yet, and some pieces of code need to change,
 especially to handle better menus change when title change but it
 eventually works.

2001-03-07 Wednesday 02:16  stef

 -Added `glib-config --libs glib` for interface compilation
 for debian/sid users

2001-03-07 Wednesday 01:36  sam

   * Disabled network input under BeOS so that it compiles again. We'll
     have to wait for BONE anyway.

2001-03-07 Wednesday 00:18  henri

 - Fixed TS input ( a nasty dead lock had appeared 4 days ago )
 - Added base of network support

 Things to be done :
 - Meuuh : fix the PCR synchronisation so that we can set b_pace_cntrol to 0
 - Sam : find a way of specifing the type of media (file, net). For the
 moment, the "--input ts" always call input_NetworkOpen
 - Maybe sam : for the moment the working syntax is vlc --input ts
 servername, it should nbe turned into "vlc --server servername".

 Things that don't work (i'll work on this this week end) :
 - stopping and retaking a stream
 - a nice 'waiting for stream'
 - we select all incoming streams. we should be able to select.

 Things that haven't been tested :
 - broadcast
 - only tested with one stream.

 Kick me if something is broken by my fault.

    Commited BeOS changes by Richard Shepherd and Tony Castley.

    include/video_output.h

       decoding needed instead of YUV-RGB
     * Will be removed later when video_output.c rewritten

    src/video_output.c
     * vout_CreateThread() initialises b_YCbr to zero

    plugins/beos/*

 -Fixed bugs in title/chapter handling once more, especially for size
 detection and location of main movie.

 -Support for multitrack DVD : now the stream is given to input as it has
 to be ; however, all the tracks are displayed one after the other ; I
 think we need to decode navigation ES to choose the track

 -Fixed behaviour at end of device.

2001-03-04 Sunday 03:12  sam

   * Added DVD/VCD button and menu for quick DVD device selection to the
     Gnome and Gtk+ interfaces, so that vlc can play a DVD even when
     launched from a GUI.

 -New function for DVD reading, that is able to read multiple blocks
 (I've chosen 32 now), that doesn't use any memcpy anymore and is also much
 faster. It is ready now for cell positioning in multi-angle DVD (to come
 soon).

 -DVD specific netlist adapted to 2048 bytes long blocks that contain
 several data_packets.

 -Modification in mpeg_system.c to use p_payload_start instead of
 p_buffer (necessary for DVD plugin). It does not break other plugins
 since they set p_payload_start to p_buffer

 -New field i_read_once in input_thread_s to be able to read more than
 the TS related 7 packets ; i_read_once is set to INPUT_READ_ONCE by
 defaults but plugins can change it during initialisation.

 Please check that nothing is broken :)

2001-02-28 Wednesday 05:20  sam

   * Additional optimizations to the subtitle decoder
   * The GGI video output should now be faster. Also, right-mouse-clicking
     works in GGI mode as well.

2001-02-26 Monday 17:41  sam

   * Optimizations done to the SPU decoder. Now the RLE is expanded at
     decoding time, not rendering time. The main loop in vout_RenderSPU
     is now 20 lines long.

2001-02-26 Monday 12:16  sam

   * The Gtk+ interface is now built as a Debian package as well. The Gnome
     package depends on it because of the icon and menu entry.
   * Added an intf_WarnHexDump() function to do raw hexadecimal dumps of
     memory areas. For debugging purposes or for real men, as you wish.
   * Lots of tidying in dvd_ioctl.c, a few comments added.
   * Better error handling in the subpicture decoder.
   * Tidied video_spu.c. More to come later.
   * Fixed subtitle displaying. Will soon work in overlay mode as well.

   (note: empty CVS mails mean that a new directory has been created,
    don't forget to use the -p option if you cvs update)

   * Added a plain Gtk+ port of the Gnome interface, for the gnome-impaired
     people. Gtk+ is now compiled by default, while Gnome isn't (you will
     have to add --enable-gnome when running configure)
   * Replaced -lcurses with -lncurses in configure.in.

2001-02-21 Wednesday 04:38  henri

 TS Input :
 - Added DemuxPSI, DecodePAT and DecodePMT. Never tested which streams
   where PAT or PMT are splitted in more than one section.
 - Some TS files still don't work (matrix.ts i.e : no sound ),
   others do ... i'll have to investigate.

 Todo :
 - What if data get unaligned ?
 - Write NetworkOpen
 - Try to find why I get no sound on matrix.ts
 - Support Stream and program selection.

  * DVD plugin is still non-functional when you don't have DVD ioctls,
    but at least it compiles under BeOS as well.
  * Minor cosmetic changes here and there.

2001-02-20 Tuesday 17:08  polux

 Second step in area management ; everything is in place now to have

   * Added Oct in the AUTHORS file.
   * Fixed a mistake in configure.in.
   * All your base are belong to us.
   * Fixed a bug in src/misc/modules which prevented loading modules
     when launched from the Tracker.
   * Fixed a similar bug in src/video_output/video_text.c.
   * BeOS CSS support, thanks to Markus Kuespert <ltlBeBoy@beosmail.com>
     who ported the Linux DVD ioctls. We can now read encrypted DVDs

  First serie of changes in DVD module for the forthcoming interface menus
  There is a new capability in input type modules for setting the
 attributes of a new area. It is set to NULL for PS and TS plugins.
  It should be called for every title change, chapter change,
 audio mode change or spu channel change.

 But this part of code is not used at the moment, and is not completed
 yet.

 Program.

 As a consequence some DVD that worked before don't work anymore.

 -Beginning of ideas to handle chapters and ES selection

   * configure.in and Makefile.in patches for better SDL support and
     support for $(bindir) $(datadir) and $(libdir) stuff, courtesy
     of Arkadiusz Miskiewicz <misiek@pld.ORG.PL>
   * Ported ggi.so to the new modules API. As for the other modules, only
     the "q" key works. Moreover, VLC doesn't exit cleanly if you close the
     GGI window.
   * Deactivated non-working widgets in the Gnome interface.
   * Added CONTRIBUTORS file.

   Hint of the day: don't expect to code quite long in your bed when sleepy.

    better solution: ./vlc dvd:/dev/disk/ide/atapi/1/master/0/raw

    Current problems: gcc doesn't like MMX-EXT instructions, and refuses
    to have register %ebx being used in the main application. Grr.

 -UDF filesystem support so that we know the location of the first video
 related file with 100% reliability (great change that should make DVDs
 with binaries and extra stuff work with vlc).

 -Correction of a bug in ifo reading that falsified the adress of
 video titles.

 -Changed the method for selecting title at start. It is _not_ reliable
 though, but it is better than the preceding one.

2001-02-17 Saturday 08:48  sam

  * Tried to fix the BeOS interface and video output. Any BeOS developers
    listening ? I can't even test that code, it probably wants additional
    fixing.
  * Added a workaround in modules.c for broken libc's which happen to truncate
    filenames in dentry structures when using 64bits offsets. The kind of
    stuff you only see in RedHats <g>.
  * Made the SDL error messages a bit more useful.
  * The Gnome menu is now created when mouse is released, not when it
    is pressed. It may sound stupid, but it really makes a difference.

2001-02-16 Friday 09:25  sam

  * Upgraded version number to 0.2.61. Release is today.

  * Fixed package building (both RPMs and .debs).
  * Fixed `make snapshot' rule.
  * Added some magic to filename detection. To read a DVD you now just
    need to run 'vlc dvd:/dev/hdc' for instance. Same for file:// URIs.
  * Fixed a segfault in the slider when no stream was playing.
  * Made the slider go from 0 to 100 (instead of 99 :)
  * The vlc now doesn't exit when finished playing. As a side effect of
    the playlist code being very recent, it continuously loops.

2001-02-16 Friday 06:37  sam

  * Fixed a segfault in the input thread creation, as well as a possible
    deadlock. This happened mostly when opening non-existing files.
  * Created input_SetStatus to do input_SetRate's job. input_SetRate will
    be used to set an arbitrary rate, for people who want to read DVDs at
    1/2.71828 times the actual speed.
  * Stubs for the ncurses control interface. No working code yet, but the
    holes just need to be filled.
  * Improved X11 support. Still not as functional as before.
  * The output window now states the method name, so that people know whether
    they are using X11 or SDL.
  * The Gnome interface is now drag'n'drop aware, you can drop a file
    on it just like Xine does (or so I guess).

2001-02-15 Thursday 07:59  sam

  * removed useless includes in intf_gnome.c
  * made the vout_sdl.c functions static
  * ported vout_x11.c to the modules API; code isn't very nice yet though

2001-02-15 Thursday 03:01  sam

  * X11 output works again. It's just the output, but it works; I now need
    to clean the code and add event handling.

2001-02-14 Wednesday 15:58  henri

 Begining of TS Input

 Done :
 - fixed netlist
 - embryo : support TS video trough file ( kludgy ... )

 Next :
 - Write DecodePSI and DemuxPSI, wich will clean the kludges off

 Then :
 - Write NetworkOpen ( shouldn't be difficult )

 Eventually :
 - Deal with lost/corrupt packets

2001-02-14 Wednesday 14:31  sam

  * Should have fixed the dependency generater for some plugins.

2001-02-14 Wednesday 07:48  sam

  * updated version information to 0.2.60 -- today's release
  * started porting the X11 vout (still disabled)
  * a few unnoticeable changes in the Gnome intf

2001-02-14 Wednesday 04:11  stef

 -Changes in the way stream size in DVD mode is calculated. It is no
 longer such an ugly kludge and is much more accurate.

 -Changes in DVDSeek so that the interface slider is in 0 when we are at
 the beginning of the strem.

 -Try to detect the beginning of the movie in the middle of the title. It
 works for most of the DVDs but will begin in the middle of the movie
 with some others.

 -Calculate only the first title key in css mode because it might take a
 long time with some title. The search stops now when we have a key once
 whereas it did stop only when we had it twice before. It should not
 cause problems.

2001-02-13 Tuesday 13:01  massiot

 * Really fixed MC segfault bug.

2001-02-13 Tuesday 10:08  stef

 -adaptation of DVD module to navigation slider. The seek has to be
 done on a multiple of 2048, and shopuld take care of the offset to the
 beginning of the stream. It works with most of my DVDs by fails to
 detect size of some streams.

 -change of the order of call to ifo and css functions in input_dvd.c,
 because we can't read ifo files before authentification on some DVDs.

 -changed location of some css tables.

 -we read ifo date and decrypt css keys for all titles now. It takes quite a
 long time to initialize with some DVDs (if you have 42 titles for
 instance). The key decryption might give a false value if the title is
 less than 10 Mb ; I'm working on that :)

2001-02-13 Tuesday 06:31  sam

  * Quick patch to avoid a segfault when arbitrarily seeking the stream.

   Meuuh: you probably have a better solution for this ; I simply don't
   know the video decoder well enough to do it myself.

2001-02-13 Tuesday 04:29  sam

  * added --intf option to vlc
  * started cleaning vout_sdl.c
  * the dummy plugin works again
  * added a slider to the Gnome interface so that we can browse through streams

   There is a problem with the slider: we sometimes get unexpected async
   replies, which would mean that we don't properly lock our Xlib calls.
   Which is true. But we also get these errors when using `--vout dummy'.
   I'll investigate.

2001-02-12 Monday 18:18  massiot

 Removed enhancement because of an incompatibility with slow motion.

2001-02-12 Monday 13:20  massiot

2001-02-12 Monday 09:58  stef

 -Much cleaning in css code. It should work fine now.

 Most of DVD with movie in title 1 should work.

 To come : support for movie in other titles.

2001-02-12 Monday 09:39  sam

  . removed tests against i_rate and i_new_rate calculation from the
    plugins and hid this complexity into input_ext-intf.c

2001-02-12 Monday 07:52  sam

   * Fixed my old stupid bug that disabled sound after having played the
     first playlist item.
   * Added `Prev' and `Next' buttons to the interface, with the beginning of
     a playlist window (still empty).
   * Added `Slow' and `Fast' buttons to the interface and popup menu.

   Ok, I promise it's the last time I check bloat in, from now the interface
   commits will be much cleaner and actually fix things :)

2001-02-12 Monday 00:20  sam

  * The pure Gnome part of the Gnome interface has been rewritten from
    scratch, and the .glade file included as well. You can edit it by
    installing glade-gnome and doing `glade plugins/gnome/intf_gnome.glade',
    or directly by hand if you grok XML.
  * Files can now be loaded into vlc using the `Open' buttons. But for the
    moment you still have to launch vlc with at least one file, because it
    quits when the end of the playlist is reached.
  * Idle screen was disabled because it eats a lot of CPU and is mostly
    useless for the moment. And it gets activated when pause lasts for too
    long.

2001-02-11 Sunday 01:15  sam

   Beginning of Interface II
  ---------------------------

  * Plugins have completely disappeared, we now only use the new module API.
  * All intf and vout modules are now independant. So far, only the Gnome
    intf module and the SDL vout module have been ported. configure.in has
    been modified to reflect the changes (x11 and dummy aren't compiled by
    default anymore, while SDL and Gnome are).

   Note that this is _not_ Interface II, it's just a step forward. For
   instance, it lacks the whole message passing scheme.

   Things that should work:

  * Right-clicking on the SDL video output window brings the Gnome menu.
  * Pause, Play, Exit, About work from the menu or from the interface window.
  * The old SDL keys still work.

    Things that are broken or may be broken:

  * Xlib calls are not locked yet, which may lead to "Unexpected async reply"
    errors, and make the vlc segfault.
  * Sound only works for the first file.
  * The SDL vout_sdl.c file is absolutely ugly and kludgey.
  * The vlc immediately quits when no filename is given as an argument. Not
    a real bug, but still annoying.
  * The Gnome menu does not work in fullscreen mode.

    Things that will come soon, maybe tomorrow:

  * Complete navigation buttons (fast forward, slow, etc.).
  * File/Open menu to add files to the playlist.
  * Return of the X11 video output for those of us who do not have SDL.
  * Textmode interface for those of us who do not have Gnome.
  * aout and vout autospawn (maybe).

2001-02-09 Friday 18:34  stef

 -Fixed a bug in #define that prevented from using ioctls

2001-02-09 Friday 03:51  stef

 -Some functions to prepare ifo commands utilisation to move in the
 structures of DVDs
 -Change in configure to avoid compiling css functions on BSD.

2001-02-08 Thursday 23:40  sam

  . added comments to src/interface/intf_plst.c and include/intf_plst.h

  . updated the TODO list (34 items to do, 41 done !)

2001-02-08 Thursday 17:44  massiot

 * Portability : changed off64_t to off_t and activated appropriate

 * Changed fseek() to fseeko() for 64-bit offsets ;
 * Reset frame predictors on a stream discontinuity.

2001-02-08 Thursday 13:52  massiot

2001-02-08 Thursday 08:08  stef

 [no log message]

2001-02-08 Thursday 07:24  sam

  . moved the playlist handling from input/input.c to interface/interface.c
  . fixed a few warnings at compile-time
  . fixed sound channel selection in playlist mode
  . added a color message in the plugin bank because on peut bien déconner
    cinq minutes, quand-même
  . we now spawn a new input thread for each file
  . added a missing pf_close() because it's always cool to close files
    after we read them

2001-02-08 Thursday 06:41  stef

 -solved bug with cssdescrambling. The vlc might segfault with dvd
 plugins. I will fix that soon.
 -minor modification in pluginification.

2001-02-08 Thursday 04:43  sam

    This commit is a bit early, but it'll save Stef, Henri and me much
  time later, when we don't have to backport modifications to input_*.c

    What's new :
     - playlist works again (still the old wrong way like Meuuh doesn't
     like, but this is going to change within a few hours)
     - input_ps, input_ts and input_dvd are now plugins, located in
     plugins/mpeg/ and plugins/dvd/

    What's broken :
     - audio output might be broken on some streams ; have to investigate

    What has changed :
     - fast/slow keys are now A/Z instead of A/S since S was already
     linked to the scale/noscale toggle.
     - `--dvd' doesn't work anymore, for the moment try to use :
      vlc --input dvd /dev/dvd
     - module bank is now less verbose ; use `--warn 1' to turn back
     verbosity on

2001-02-08 Thursday 01:34  stef

 -New method using netlist to read packets on DVD device by sectors of
 2048 bytes.
 -Some modifications in netlist to make it work with DVD.
 -Fixed à bug in mpeg_system.c

 We use INPUT_READ_ONCE many times in the input code. I think that
 we should replace it with a field in input_thread_t to give more
 flexibility to modules. I have done it in DVD plugin but it can't work
 if input.c is limited by INPUT_READ_ONCE.

 The DVD method is slower than input_ps ; but there are things to
 improve.
 CSS descrambling is broken.

  . removed obsolete video_yuv_mmx.S
  . updated the TODO list and wrote a small todo.pl parser to make it
    easier to see which items remain to be done
  . `make snapshot' now creates vlc-*.tar.gz and vlc-*-nocss.tar.gz

2001-01-31 Wednesday 03:42  sam

  . version 0.2.50 for the Linux Expo
  . --overlay and --fulscreen options (only work with --vout sdl)
  . the vlc exits after the end of the stream, which prevents from having
    to kill it and relaunch it during a presentation, just script it like :

       for i in ~/mpeg/* ; do vlc --fullscreen --overlay --vout sdl $i ; done

  Yes, I know the --overlay stuff is fucking ugly. But *I* am not the one
   who redefines vout_sys_t in an interface-related source file. I won't
   change it until the vout/intf is finished being rewritten.

  Additional information: if "--overlay --fulscreen" doesn't center your
   picture, try with your screen geometry, eg:
   "--overlay --fullscreen --width 1024 --height 768"

2001-01-31 Wednesday 03:24  sam

  . version 0.2.0 pour la linux expo
  . ajout des options --fullscreen et --overlay

  . not a very nice hack, but will probably spare us a few user complaints: if
   no -a option is specified, the vlc will play the first audio type it finds,
   so there is no need to specify "-a ac3" for a DVD anymore.

     The motion compensation routines are now modules as well ; choose your
   implementation with `--motion motion', `--motion motionmmx' or
   `--motion motionmmxext'. Of course, the best implementation is chosen
   if you don't ask for any. There doesn't seem to be any performance hit
   due to the move to shared libs, which is a good thing. Please test
   actively if you have time, though.

     Updated --help result, manpage, INSTALL document, and a few files.

     I moved vdec_motion.h and vpar_blocks.h back to /include because they
   will be needed to build motion compensation modules, but perhaps we don't
   need to export everything which is in these files.

     /src/video_decoder/ now has only one .c file, perhaps it could now be
   merged with video_parser ?

2001-01-17 Wednesday 18:17  massiot

 I'm interested in performance feedback.

2001-01-16 Tuesday 16:09  sam

  . a few changes in the CPU extensions detection code, borrowed from the
    kernel and from mpeg2dec. I still don't know how to detect if code
    compiled with -mcpu=pentiumpro will run, since the cpuid arcanes are
    quite obtuse to me. Perhaps we should also have a way not to load modules
    if they have been compiled with a different CPU to avoid segfaults.

2001-01-16 Tuesday 14:05  sam

  . add check for MMX EXT extensions, which doesn't work, which is a good
    thing since there is no MMX EXT IDCT yet :)

  [ include/config.h.in has changed, don't forget tu run ./configure ]

  . fixed the --aout, --idct and --yuv flags
  . updated manpage and --(long)help output to reflect that change
  . removed a few unneeded #includes here and there
  . cosmetic changes in error messages in input.c

    Currently available flags are now :

      --aout dummy
             esd
             dsp
             alsa

      --idct idct
             idctclassic
             idctmmx

      --yuv yuv
            yuvmmx

   --vout works like before, but still uses the old plugin system for now.

2001-01-16 Tuesday 04:41  stef

 . Now use of 64 bits offsets to parse the whole DVD. So we have all the
 available information
 . Fixed a bug in parsing of VTS attributes
 . Fixed a bug in input.c that made input plugin initialize even though
 no stream is reachable (thanks Sam)

 I hope I'll be able to get the position of the movie soon.

 Meuuh : the seek function of the plugin now take off_t as argument which
 could be a problem later. Maybe it should take off64_t or time argument.

2001-01-16 Tuesday 02:16  sam

  . merged the YUV plugins in the same directory to avoid too much code
    duplication
  . YUV transformations now use the new module API ; now only the vout
    and interface still depend on the old plugin API
  . changed TestMMX to TestCPU because we will be able to test for other
    specific extensions (3DNow, SSE) for the forthcoming IDCT we'll
    borrow to mpeg2dec (as usual :P)
  . don't show "hiding module" messages anymore except in debug mode
  . swapped C IDCT and Classic IDCT scores since the classic one seems
    to be faster ; anyway you should use the MMX one
  . fixed a Makefile bug under BeOS
  . tried to fix the cpuid code so that it compiles under BeOS (Polux, can
    you test it when you have time ?)

    you think ?

  . fixed the Makefile to spare a few variables here and there.

  . reduced module hide delay, removed loading of the audio output
    plugins since they are now modules.

  . changed a few intf_Msg to intf_DbgMsg, and added "vout:", "intf:",
    and so on in a few other messages.

  . removed unused includes in the idct modules.

2001-01-15 Monday 03:26  stef

 . DVD mode is enabled with option --dvd. For the moment, it only read
 the first vts and find the movie if it is at the beginning of the title
 set.

 Coming soon:
 . udf filesystem management to access over 2Gb zones.
 . detection of the offset to the movie inside a vts when it is not at
 the beginning.

 Is there a chance that using fopen/fseek function instead of open/lseek
 system calls solve the 2Gb issue ?

    our optimized IDCT, and MMX IDCT.
  . cosmetic changes for modules (pf_* instead of p_*)
  . fixes to the BeOS and dummy modules

    WARNING: a new directory has been added, which means you have to
    use `cvs update -dP' to update ; files have been removed , which means
    you either have to run `make distclean' or remove the .deps directory,
    and the configure script has changed, which means you have to run it
    again. Don't complain before having checked this :)

    Note about the IDCT modules: there is no way to choose the one we
    use, but you may remove the module in lib/ to prevent it from being
    loaded. The preference order is : MMX, Optimized, Classic.

 * Fixed bugs in program.c that prevented vlc to close all decoders ;
 * Gave sam a lesson for the use of the bitstream in spu_decoder.c :ppp ;
 * Made the video parser unlock the reference pictures before quitting
 (still one left, yaknow why ?)

2001-01-12 Friday 14:49  sam

  . destroy fifo mutex and cond variables _after_ they are used for
    the last time. henri, that'll be one binouze.

2001-01-12 Friday 13:15  sam

   . Attempt to port the BeOS audio plugin to the new module API. Will
     probably need a few fixes to work or even compile.

2001-01-12 Friday 12:48  henri

 Done :
 - ported the alsa plugin to the news vlc module API
 - cosmetic changes

 To do :
 - check if it works with the latest alsa release
 - add features ... prepare for 4 or more speakers

 * Fixed 32 bits bitstream bugs.

2001-01-11 Thursday 17:44  sam

   . moved the MPEG audio decoder to the new bitstream

     I wasn't sure whether the bits counting method was effective to
   skip ancillary data at the end of a frame, but I kept it for
   safety. There is still a lot to optimize in the bit counting, like
   unrolling the first iteration of some loops, but I don't know if
   it would be worth it. The other solution would have been to look for
   a startcode after eache frame, without caring about the ancillary bits.

   . cleaning in the SPU decoder.

2001-01-11 Thursday 15:35  sam

  . moved swab32 from input_ext-dec.h to common.h. We probably won't need
    it anymore really soon, since ntohl() and htonl() seem to be properly
    optimized when gcc is passed the right optimization flags.

  . fixed GetBits32 and RemoveBits32. I know the #ifdefs are useless since
    we only support u32 words, but it's a safe reminder. Comments appreciated
    on this fix since I may have b0rked something -- it runs well here though.

2001-01-10 Wednesday 19:48  sam

  . fixed a missing #ifdef STATS
     *grin*

2001-01-10 Wednesday 19:22  massiot

 * Changed code for handling b_die in bitstream ;
 * Move input_ext-dec.h to input.h ;
 * New input_NullPacket function ;
 * Fixed init bugs in input and vpar ;

2001-01-10 Wednesday 16:24  massiot

 * Placed a callback to the decoder in the bitstream structure ;
 * Fixed a purify bug in input_ps.c ;
 * Added -mcpu=pentiumpro in the Makefile.

2001-01-10 Wednesday 02:33  sam

  . complete commenting of modules_core.h and small modifications
  . separated MODULE_CONFIG_START and ADD_WINDOW (Henri, beware)
  . fixed a very, very old bug that caused namespace collision between
    plugins (Henri, beware: call your aout_getplugin function like this,
    not alsa_aout_getplugin)
  . removed the Debian specific clean rules from the Makefile, since they
    are already handled by the debian/rules script.
  . tidied a few compilation rules (-lfoo should always be at the end)

2001-01-09 Tuesday 23:29  sam

  . just removed a forgotten debug message in the setpalette code

2001-01-09 Tuesday 22:30  octplane

 .Added 8bits palette SDL support.
 .Tried to add it to stable, failed, probably because of the initialisation codes which are differents...

2001-01-09 Tuesday 21:03  sam

  . fixed a warning under FreeBSD (dlerror() is a const char*, not a char*).
  . made configure script look for the bswap assembly instruction (using
    AC_TRY_COMPILE makes sure the compiler will really accept it).

2001-01-08 Monday 22:56  bozo

   - maybe found the fullscreen bug, please test :)

2001-01-08 Monday 22:42  bozo

   - fixed colors' bug (TODO: write a function in vout that recalculate colors
     from RGB masks);
   - cleaning of the fullscreen switch, still sucks but the surface is not
     reallocated and that's good (thanks to the magic function
     SDL_WM_ToggleFullScreen provided by sdl library :).

2001-01-08 Monday 18:16  sam

  . Added a missing mutex_unlock in video_output.c
  . Moved a mutex_destroy after the thread cancellation to prevent
    possible problems
  . Added a missing #ifdef in intf_msg.c which prevented compilation
    with --enable-debug
  . Fixed a bug in the input that prevented to quit properly in certain
    cases (some ES were not deleted because their index was skipped when
    the former one was deleted, well Meuuh should know what I mean)

   There is still a segfault when quitting, most presumably in the
  audio output. I couldn't find what causes it yet.

2001-01-08 Monday 01:07  bozo

   - cleaning of SDL Lock/Unlock Surface.

2001-01-07 Sunday 17:07  sam

  . added a .cvsignore file in lib/ so that the directory doesn't get
    removed whenever one does a cvs update -dP
  . fixed debian/.cvsignore because of a new version of debhelper

2001-01-07 Sunday 16:17  sam

  . all plugins now compile with -fPIC.

  . made the audio_output API a bit simpler.

  . got rid of modules_config.h.

  . fixed `make install' rule.

  . fixed warnings in the MMX YUV compilation.

  . probably fixed a bug in the input : pp_foo structures were free()d at
    the end, but this was useless since the last call to realloc() is
    equivalent to free(), and two consecutive calls to free() aren't a
    goo idea.

  . we check that the version number match and that we don't already have
    a module by that name when loading a new module.

  . all public module_* functions now properly lock the module bank.

  . the audio_output now uses the new module API ; EsounD and DSP modules
    have been ported, which should be enough for Henri to port the ALSA one.

    The new plugin API is now much simpler ; it's now just a matter of
 calling module_Need( p_main->p_module_bank, MODULE_CAPABILITY_FOO, p_data );
 and if successful we get the best module. Capabilities can be ORed, so that
 one can ask for a plugin that does VOUT _and_ INTF actions for instance.

    It's not complete yet though -- by making it generic I had to do a few
 ugly casts here and there, which I am going to fix ASAP. Also, command line
 selection of a plugin does not work yet.

    The switch to the new plugin API has probably broken the BeOS audio
 output ; we can either wait until the whole vlc has switched to the new
 plugins, or create a separate beos_sound.so that conforms to the new API.

2001-01-07 Sunday 15:58  octplane

 NoSEGfault Klüdge added.

2001-01-07 Sunday 15:57  octplane

 Modified the klüdge.

2001-01-07 Sunday 13:11  octplane

 Fixed the SDL segfault but removed SDL cleanup code.
 I'm still looking for the segfault's cause...

2001-01-07 Sunday 06:40  benny

 Hum, ouais bon ben euhh, j'avais fume, donc je repare mes conneries et je
 vais me coucher.

 Optimisation de BinaryLog

2001-01-07 Sunday 04:31  henri

 - Order : if a then b are initialized, release b then a ;
 - Typos ;
 - Cosmetic changes.

2001-01-07 Sunday 03:56  henri

 - Added vlc_mutex_destroy and vlc_cond_destroy function, for pthreads.
 - Used them before quitting, every lock and cond is destroyed
 - Checked the return value of malloc and realloc in input_programs
 - Cosmetic changes

 TODO: add vlc_*_destroy for beos and C_thread

2001-01-06 Saturday 08:05  benny

 Fixed compilation pb under solaris 2.6

2001-01-06 Saturday 08:04  benny

 Fixed solaris libraries

2001-01-06 Saturday 07:23  sam

  . should compile & run on Solaris with ./configure --disable-dsp
     (tested on puma)
  . removed most SYS_SOLARIS #ifdef's in favour of more generic tests
  . updated example ./configure line in INSTALL file
  . now we only load modules that end with ".so"
  . null module is compiled by default

2001-01-06 Saturday 05:44  henri

 Fixed a typo than prevented from building ...

2001-01-06 Saturday 03:16  henri

 Fixed initialization of payload_start and payload_end
 It should be finished now.

2001-01-05 Friday 18:46  massiot

 BSD port, including :
 * --enable-sdl and some others are now --with-sdl[=name] to supply an
 optional library name ;
 * deleted all unnecessary #include <sys/uio.h> ;
 * /usr/include is now searched when looking for libraries and headers.

 It seems to compile and run on BSD. Under Linux Sam's latest commit makes
 vlc crash on startup, so I can't really tell, but hey it compiles.

2001-01-05 Friday 18:06  sam

  . src/misc/modules.c is in a workable state now.

   To test it, run ./configure with the --enable-null flag, which will
   compile the Null Module as a plugin. Watch the memory usage at the
   launch and when the plugin is released.

2001-01-05 Friday 14:46  sam

 (previous commit foired)

  . this is a coding style patch which removes all "foo(bar){" constructions
    and most of the tabulations.
  . also, fixed a bug in the default subtitle track.
  . and made a few error messages more explicit, ie. changed "error: %s" to
    "foo error: couldn't initialize bar (%s)"
  . and removed a warning in intf_ctrl.c which isn't used anyway.

  . splitted modules.h into modules.h and modules_core.h to enable
     clean compilation of the Null Module.

2001-01-05 Friday 14:24  sam

  . added the Null Module, the module that does nothing but that is going
     to be of great help for debugging my module code.

2001-01-05 Friday 13:57  sam

  . Added files needed for the forthcoming module management.

  Notes:

    Plugins are now called modules, because we will be able to compile
    them either as a dynamic plugin, or within the program. And, more
    important, I can commit this without having to break the vlc :)

    I tried to be as clear as possible in my comments, please tell me
    if a few prototypes still have an unclear beahaviour.

    Current features:
     . none, files haven't even been added to the Makefile yet.

    Future features:
     . dynamic loading (done)
     . built-in modules (still to do)
     . automatic unloading of plugins (done)
     . dynamic configuration (still to do)
     . automatic choosing of the most appropriate plugin for a given
        task (still to do but well prepared)

2001-01-04 Thursday 23:18  bozo

   - fixed pitch bug;
   - fixed segfault, it was probably a memory corruption but I'm not sure :) ;
   - video_output.c : compute picture size even if b_need_render == 0;

2001-01-04 Thursday 19:11  massiot

 Fixed a deadlock.

2001-01-04 Thursday 18:47  massiot

 * Fixed a deadlock (the vout unlocked a mutex locked by another thread,
 grrrr, I'll kill someone) ;
 * Put config.h in front of others in audio_decoder.c.

2001-01-02 Tuesday 14:03  massiot

 Better display of the fps.
