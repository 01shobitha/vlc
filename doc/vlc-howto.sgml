  <heading>What is VideoLAN ?</heading>
  <p>
   VideoLAN is a project of sudents of the École Centrale Paris which aims 
   to broadcast video on the campus, and provide the students with a MPEG2 
   software-only decoder. VideoLAN is an OpenSource project which will thus 
   allow anyone to watch DVD movies under Linux, BeOS, MacOS X, Windows 
   and most Unix 
   systems
  </p>
  <p>
    You may want to look at the port section on our website : 
    <htmlurl url="http://www.videolan.org" name="http://www.videolan.org/">.

 <sect1>
  <heading>What is the vlc</heading>
  <p>
   Vlc stands for VideoLAN client. It is the name of the program which is
   capable of decoding MPEG streams, and displaying them onto your screen,
   so you can watch you favourite movies, confortably sit in your armchair
   :-).

  <heading>Disclaimer</heading> 
  <p> 
   This documentation is given "as is", and any comment and improvement
   are welcome. 
  </p>

  <p>
   In this HOWTO, we consider you already have a little knowledge about
   Linux, and you know how to use a DVD. If not, good howtos can be
   found on the Linux Documentation Projet.

 <heading>Quick start</heading>
  
  <p> This section will help you get, install and use vlc without giving you
  much details.
  </p>

 <sect1>
  <heading>Get and install vlc from binary packages</heading>
  <p>
   The first thing to do is to get an archive, on our web site 
   <htmlurl url="http://www.videolan.org/download.html" name="http://www.videolan.org/download.html">
  </p>
 
  <sect2>
   <heading>Which package to chose ?</heading>
   <p>
    There are different packages because vlc has "plugins" which provide 
    features but also enlarge the executable and require external libs. 
   </p>
   <p>
    SDL is a lib which allows you to have an accelerated video output.
    You will need libsdl > 1.1.6
   </p>
   <p>
    If you're using the enlightened sound daemon, you may want to try 
    the esd-aware vlc.
   </p>
   <p>
    Generally, when you don't know what a module name is, you don't 
    need/use it :-)
   </p>
  </sect2>
  
  <sect2>
   <heading>Debian package</heading>
   <p>
    Just use dpkg :
    <verb>
     dpkg -i vlc-x.x.x.deb
    </verb>
   </p>
   <p>
    Depending on the package you have downloaded, you may have dependency
    problems. You have to solve them, by installing the required libs.
   </p>
  </sect2>
   
  <sect2>
    <heading>RPM package</heading>
   <p>
    Install vlc just as you would install any rpm package : 
    <verb>
     rpm -i vlc-x.x.x.rpm
    </verb>
   </p>
   <p>
    You may have to install external libs to meet dependencies, depending on
    the package you downloaded (gnome, gtk, esd, ...).
   </p>
  </sect2>

  <sect2>
   <heading>BeOS users</heading>
   <p>
    Double-click on the archive. It should open your favorite archive extracter.
    You can then execute the vlc from there, or extract the archive to a 
    diretory and run it from there.
   </p>
  </sect2>
  
  <sect2>
   <heading>MacOS X users</heading>
   <p>
    To be completed
   </p>
  </sect2> 
  <sect2>
   <heading>Windows users</heading>
   <p>
    Decompress the archive with your favourite extracter in a directory of your
    choice.
   </p>
  </sect2>
 </sect1>
 
 <sect1>
  <heading>Get libdvdcss</heading>
  <p>
   In order to read CSSsrambled DVDs, you will need libdvdcss. 
   You can find binary
   packages for your distribution here : <htmlurl 
   name="http://www.videolan.org/libdvdcss/download/index.html" 
   url="http://www.videolan.org/libdvdcss/download/index.html">
  </p>
 </sect1>
 
 <sect1>
  <heading>Use the vlc for DVD reading</heading>
  <p>
  Launch the application simply by typing vlc in a terminal (or by 
  double-clicking on its icon in a graphical shell). You should see
  the graphical interface appear.
  </p>

  <p> 
  For reading a DVD (or a VCD), click on the "Disc" button. The new window 
  you must then enter the path to your DVD or VCD drive :

   <sect2>
    <heading>Linux users</heading>
    <p>
     Usually, you dvd device is /dev/hd? (if you have an ide drive).
     For instance, if you DVD player is master on the second IDE device,
     it will be /dev/hdc.
    </p>
    <p>
     It is very useful to create a symlink to this file, called /dev/dvd. 
     To do this, as root, type (if your dvd device is /dev/hdc for example) :
     <verb>
      ln -s /dev/hdc /dev/dvd
     </verb>
     Also make sure you have read AND write permission to the device 
     (otherwise dvd decryption won't work).
    </p>
   </sect2>
   <sect2>
    <heading>Windows users</heading>
    <p>
     The path to your DVD drive usually is D: or E:. You may have a look
     in "My Computer" and look to which letter your DVD drive is assigned.
    </p>
   </sect2>
   <sect2>
    <heading>BeOS users</heading>
    <p>
      Under BeOS, the dvd device looks like 
      "/dev/disk/ide/atapi/1/slave/0/raw" for example, if your dvd device is 
      slave on your first (not sure) ide device.
    </p>
   </sect2>
   <sect2>
    <heading>Other OS</heading>
    <p>
    To do ...
    </p>
   </sect2>
  <sect1>
   <heading>Use the vlc for network streaming</heading>
   <p>
    This is the vlc original usage. 
   </p>
   
   <p>
    Launch the vlc as you would have for DVD reading. Then click on the 
    "Network" button. 
    </p>
    <sect2>
     <heading>If using a VideoLAN Channel Server</heading>
     <p>
      The only thing you have to do is to check the "Channel server" box
      and to enter the IP address and port 
      of this channel
      server. Ask your administrator if you don't have it. Then click on OK.
     </p>
     <p>
      You will see a new "Channel" field in the interface. You may now
      enter the selected channel and click on OK. After a few seconds,
      if a program is being sent in this channel, you should see the program
      start.
     </p>
     <p>
      If nothing appears and you are sure that a program is broadcasted in
      this channel, you may try once again, because a problem of communication
      with the channel server could have occured (in you launched vlc from
      a terminal, you should see "Network error: no answer from vlcs").
     </p>
    </sect2>
    <sect2>
     <heading>Without VideoLAN Channel Server</heading>
     <p>
      Simply choose clicking on the network button, then on ok should be 
      sufficient in most cases.
     </p>
     <p>
      After clicking on OK, and if a program is being sent, you should see
      a window open with your program.
     </p>
    </sect2>

<sect>
 <heading>The graphical interface</heading>
 <p>
  Please note that the gnome, gtk and win32 interfaces are currently the most
  advanced. The following descriptions refer to them.
 </p>
 <sect1>
  <heading>Opening a stream</heading>
  <p>
   For opening streams through the graphical interface, click on either
   "File" for opening a file stored on your hard drive, "Disc" for 
   opening a DVD or a VCD, "Network" for reading a stream from a vls 
   or through http input, or "Satellite" for reading directly 
   from a satellite card.
  </p>
 <sect1>
  <heading>Basic stream control</heading>
  <p>
   You have at your disposal all the classical control of a video player.
   For example when playing local streams, you can do pauses, speed up or
   slow down the stream ... Just use the corresponding buttons.
  </p>
 <sect1>
  <heading>DVD and VCD navigation</heading>
  <p>
   When reading a DVD or a VCD, you can change chapter and title either 
   by using the

 </sect1>
 
 <sect1>
  <heading>Programs, audio and subtitles</heading>
  <p>
   When reading a multiprogram stream, you can change the current program
   by selecting it in the "View/Programs" submenu, or using the "right click"
   menu from the video output window.
  </p>
  <p>
   In DVDs, if different angles are availables, they will be treated as
   different programs.
  </p>
  <p>
   At any time you can change the audio/subtitles channel using either the 
   "setting" menu from the interface or using the "right click" menu from
   the video output window.
  </p>
 <sect1>
  <heading>Preferences window</heading>
  <p>
   By choosing "Preferences" in the "Settings" menu, you will open 
   the preferences window. This window is generated dynamically according
   to the modules that were compiled.

    such as the window size or if you would like fullscreen display.
   </p>
  </sect2>
  <sect2>
   <heading>Input tab</heading>
   <p>
    In this tab, you can enter the input method with options (for example
    <tt>udp:@239.255.255.42</tt>) that will be used on next start. You can 
    also add some settings, such as the channel server address ...
   </p>
  </sect2>

<sect>
 <heading>Command line options</heading>
 <p>
 Many options are only available through command line. They are detailled here.
 </p>
 <sect1>
  <heading>Opening streams</heading>
  <p> 
  The following commands start vlc and add a first element to the playlist.
  </p>
  <sect2>
   <heading>Opening a file</heading>
   <p>
    Simply start vlc with <tt>vlc my_file.mpg</tt>. 
   </p>
   <p>
    You may tell vlc what input to use, for example add <tt>--input ts</tt>
    when playing a ts MPEG, although vlc should be able to recognize the type
    of MPEG.
   </p>
  </sect2>
  <sect2>
   <heading>Opening a DVD or VCD</heading>
   <p>
    Simply start vlc with <tt>vlc dvd:DVDDRIVE</tt> or <tt> vlc vcd:CDROMDRIVE
    </tt>, where DVDDRIVE/CDROMDRIVE is the complete
    path to your dvd/cdrom drive.
   </p>
   <p>
    You may add <tt>-t X -T Y</tt> to start directly from the Xth chapter, Yth
    title.
   </p>
  </sect2>
  <sect2>
  <heading>Start a network stream</heading>
   <p>
    To receive an UDP stream (being sent from a VLS), start vlc with 
    <tt> vlc udpstream:[@&lt;bind address&gt;[:&lt;server port&gt;]] </tt>.
   </p>
   <p>
    Please note that bind address refers to the destination address, for 
    example your broadcast address. If the stream is being broadcasted, 
    <verb> vlc udpstream:</verb> should be sufficient. If the stream
    is multicasted, you must specify the multicast address, for example 
    <verb> vlc udpstream:@239.255.255.42  </verb>

   
   </p>
  </sect2>
 </sect1>
 
 <sect1>
  <heading>Modules selection</heading>
  <p>
   The vlc tries to select the most appropriate interface, input and output
   modules, among the ones available on the system, according to
   the stream he is given to read. However, you may wish to force
   the use of a specific module with the following options:

 <heading>Building the vlc from sources</heading>
 <p>
  You can choose either to take the latest release, or a CVS source. Note that
  CVS snapshots may be broken, although we do our best to prevent this from
  happening.
 </p>
 <p>
  From here, you have to be a little experienced, even more if you want to use
  the cvs.
 </p>
 <sect1>
  <heading>Getting an archive</heading>
  <p>
   You have guessed it, the first thing to do is to get the source.
   Until there, everyone should understand :)
  </p>
  <sect2>
   <heading>Web site</heading>
   <p>
    Source packages can be found in the "tarballs" section of the download page :
    <htmlurl url="http://www.videolan.org/download.html" name="http://www.videolan.org/dowload.html">.
   </p>
   <p>
    CVS snapshots are available from the address : 
    <htmlurl url="http://www.videolan.org/packages/snapshots/" 
    name="http://www.videolan.org/packages/snapshots/">.
   </p>
   <p>
    Then untar the archive :
    <verb>
     tar xzf vlc-x-x-x.tar.gz
    </verb>
   </p>
  </sect2>
  <sect2>
   <heading>Directly from CVS</heading>
   <p> <label id="cvs">
    Firs log in as suer anonymous with an empty password :
    <verb>
     cvs -d :pserver:anonymous@anoncvs.videolan.org:/var/cvs/videolan login
    </verb>
   Then retrieve the repository :
   <verb>
    cvs -d :pserver:anonymous@anoncvs.videolan.org:/var/cvs/videolan -z3 checkout vlc
   </verb>
   </p>
  </sect2>
  <sect2>
   <heading>libdvdcss</heading>
   <p>
   To compile vlc with dvd support, you need to get and install libdvdcss.
   </p>
   <p>
   It is available for download here : 
   <htmlurl url="http://www.videolan.org/libdvdcss/download.html"
   name="http://www.videolan.org/libdvdcss/download.html">

   Decompress the tarball in a directory of your choice and build it :
   <verb>
    tar -xvzf libdvdcss-x.x.x.tar.gz
    cd libdvdcss-x.x.x
    ./configure
    make
    [as root] make install
   </verb>

   You can also find binaries packages for many distributions.
 </sect1>
 
 <sect1>
  <heading>Building the program</heading>
  <p><label id="compile">
   Go into the vlc directory and run the configure script :
   <verb>
    ./configure
   </verb>
    If you want to enable options, you may add "--enable-option" 
    to the previous line.
    For example, to build with the xvideo extension, and alsa support, 
    you should type :
    <verb>
    ./configure --enable-xvideo --enable-alsa
    </verb>
   To get the list of the available options, and know if they are 
   enabled by default,
   you can try :
   <verb>
    ./configure --help
   </verb>
  </p>
  <p>
   Also have a look on the <ref id="modules" name="following modules 
   descriptions">.
  </p>
  <p>
   A very typical installation, on a XFree 4.1 system, recent video card, with 
   gnome, is :
   <verb>
    ./configure --enable-esd --enable-gnome
   </verb>
  <p>
 </sect1>
 <sect1>
  <heading>Plugins, builtins ...</heading>
  <p>
   The configure script should create a Makefile.opts file, which you can edit and modify.
   Indeed you can chose to have features (as esd support, for example) built as plugins
   or inside the program.
  </p>
  <p>
   If you build a feature as a plugin, it can lead to a little loss of performance.
   It you build it inside the code, it'll enlarge a bit the size of the executable.
  </p>
  <p>
   When you're done with Makefile.opts (which also works if you leave it 
   untouched), just 
   type:
    <verb>
    make
    </verb>
   It should compile without any error. If there are, please check you 
   have the required libs 
   installed on your system, as the configure script can't check them all.
  </p>
  <p>
   When you're done with it, as root, type :
   <verb>
    make install

   <heading>What is required ?</heading>
   <p>
    At the present time, the satellite input only works under Linux. 
    It requires that drivers version 0.9.4 of the card, drivers

   <heading>Building the vlc with satellite support</heading>
   <p>
    Get the sources, either from our last .tar.gz release, 
    or best from the cvs (see <ref name="cvs instructions"
    id="cvs">).
   </p>
   <p>
    Move to the vlc directory, then launch
    <verb>
     ./configure --enable-satellite
    </verb>
    You may add other compilation options, see <ref 
    name="compilation instructions" id="compile">.
    Then launch the compilation with
    <verb>
     make
    </verb>
    You may install it with (as root)
    <verb>
     make install
    </verb>
    or run it from the current directory.
   </p>
  </sect2>
  <sect2>
   <heading>Running it from the command line</heading>
   <p>
   Run the vlc with 
    <verb>
     vlc satellite:&lt;frequency(Hz)&gt;,&lt;polarization(0 for V,
     1 for H)&lt;,
     &gt;FEC (1 for 1/2, 2 for 2/3 ...)&gt;,&lt;symbol rate (kbytes/sec)&gt;
    </verb>
    You then have to select your program, either with the command line option
    <verb>
     --input_program <program_number (also called service ID)>
    </verb>
    or by choosing it in the view/programs menu.
   </sect2>
   <sect2>
    <heading>Running it from the GTK/Gnome interface</heading>
    <p>
     Click on the "Sat" icon. In the opening box, you may enter 
     your transponder settings, then click on "Ok". 
    </p>
    <p>
     After a few seconds, the word satellite should appear under the command
     buttons. You may now choose your program from the View/Programs menu.

   <heading>Use the vlc to create image walls.</heading>
   <p>
    The idea is to use several video sources, each one displaying a part 
    of the whole image, to get a bigger result.
   </p>
   <p> 
    Vlc and the VideoLAN solution can provide a good way to create
    such displays : a vls broadcasts a stream in several vlc each
    display a part of image.
   </p>
   <p>
    For this, you should use the wall filter : start vlc with 
    <verb>
     vlc udp: --filter wall:&lt;number of rows&gt;x&lt;number of columns&gt;
     :&lt;number of the part to diplay&gt;
    </verb>
   </p>

   First of all, it something seems to go wrong, read and try to 
   understand the error messages. If you are a confirmed user, you 
   may try the "-vvv" option which makes the vlc very verbose.
