How to create new subtitles fonts
---------------------------------

VLC uses run-length encoded fonts. We already provide 2 of these fonts
(share/font-eutopiabold21.rle and share/font-eutopiabold36.rle) but you might
also want to generate your own.

Two (very basic) perl scripts are provided to generate these fonts files,
vlc-gimp.pl and vlc-font.pl. vlc-gimp.pl is perl-fu, and uses gimp's font
plotting routines to create an image, which should be saved as an RAW PNM.
Installing vlc-gimp.pl with "gimptool --install-bin vlc-gimp.pl" will add a new
entry in the Xtns/Perl-Fu menu in gimp.
vlc-font.pl extracts the characters from the raw PNM, and creates a run-length
encoded font file which VLC can use. As already stated these scripts are quite
basic so you will have to hack them to your liking.

Also note that the subtitler engine in VLC is currently being replaced to use
the freetype library which will allow the use of fonts already available on
your system and some other new powerful features.
