/**
 * @mainpage libvlc-cil documentation
 *
 * @section Introduction
 *
 * libvlc-cil is a thin API layer around LibVLC,
 * the VideoLAN's project media framework C library.
 * LibVLC comes built-in the VLC media player.
 *
 * With libvlc-cil, you can use LibVLC
 * from within the .Net Common Language Runtime,
 * with the CIL programming language of your preference.
 * However, libvlc-cil and the code sample in this documentation
 * are written is C#.
 *
 * @section Installation
 *
 * libvlc-cil does <b>not</b> include the underlying LibVLC by default.
 * Make sure VLC, or at least LibVLC and the relevant VLC plugins are present.
 * The LibVLC runtime library needs to be in the library search path for the
 * Common Language Runtime. Check the documentation for your CLR for details.
 *
 * On Windows, libvlc.dll needs to be in the current directory, the DLL path
 * of the running process, or the system search path (but the latter is
 * uncommon and not supported by the official LibVLC installer).
 *
 * On Linux, libvlc.so should be in /usr/lib; if it is in another directory,
 * such as /usr/local/lib, you might need to add that directory to the
 * LD_LIBRARY_PATH environment variable.
 *
 * @section Usage
 *
 * First, you need to create a VLC instance. This will load and setup the
 * native VLC runtime, the VLC configuration, the list of available plugins,
 * the platform adaptation and the VLC log messages and objects subsystems
 * @code
 * using System;
 * using VideoLAN.LibVLC;
 * ...
 *
 * try {
 *     Console.WriteLine("Running on VLC version {0}", VLC.Version);
 * }
 * catch (Exception e) {
 *     Console.WriteLine("VLC is not available on your system.");
 *     throw e;
 * }
 *
 * string[] args = new string[]{ "-v", "--ignore-config" };
 * VLC vlc = new VLC(args);
 * @endcode
 * @see VideoLAN::LibVLC::VLC
 *
 * To play media, you need a media and a player.
 * @code
 * Media media = new Media(vlc, "http://www.example.com/video.ogv");
 * Player player = new Player(media);
 * player.Play();
 * @endcode
 * @see VideoLAN::LibVLC::Media @see VideoLAN::LibVLC::Player
 *
 * All these objects use unmanaged resources.
 * They all implement the IDisposeable interface.
 * You should dispose them when you do not need them anymore:
 * @code
 * player.Dispose();
 * media.Dispose();
 * vlc.Dispose();
 * @endcode
 */
