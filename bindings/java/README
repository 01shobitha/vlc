            First of all, this is a *developers* only version


Compiling JVLC
--------------

 In order to use these bindings you have to compile vlc from source, be sure
to use the latest git version (see http://wiki.videolan.org/Git for instructions
on how to get the latest vlc version).

 JVLC depends on JNA, you can download JNA from http://jna.dev.java.net .

 JVLC is developed using the Sun JDK version 6, but version 5 should be fine too.

 Until the build.xml will be ready, you may compile jvlc issueing from the bindings
java folder:

mkdir output
javac -d output -cp <path-to>/jna.jar -g org/videolan/jvlc/internal/*.java org/videolan/jvlc/event/*.java  org/videolan/jvlc/*.java VLCExample.java VlcClient.java

 where <path-to> is the folder where the file jna.jar is contained
 and in the output folder you'll find the compiled classes.

 You may also import jvlc in eclipse running the createEclipseProject.sh script.


Running JVLC Example
--------------------

 To run a Java VLC example issue (be sure you have an a.avi and a.mp3 files
in your user.dir folder):

java -cp .:<path-to>jna.jar -Djna.library.path=/usr/local/lib VLCExample


(if you have specified a prefix in configure, change /usr/local/lib to 
PREFIX/lib)


 Happy playing.
