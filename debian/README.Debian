Notes for anyone wanting to build Debian packages of VLC.

 - Default configuration is supposed to be latest unstable.

 - Usually VLC will come with a copy of ffmpeg and faad2 in the extras/
   directory, because they are not yet available in Debian.

 - If there is no CVS directory in the root, debian/rules will assume a
   full build is requested and will clean ffmpeg and faad2.

 - VLC does not link with libdvdcss by default, thus it will not depend
   on the libdvdcss packages. To build packages that link against it,
   remove the --without-dvdcss flag in debian/rules.
