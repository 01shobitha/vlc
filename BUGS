   Please try to keep this file up to date. Also, grep for FIXME in the
source files for more and more bugs to fix.

   For information on how to post a useful bug report, please read
doc/bugreport-howto.txt.


Core:

  * vlc_cond_broadcast unimplemented on most plaforms.

  * --<moduletype> <module>:<args> doesn't work anymore.


Input:

  -


Audio output:

  * Audio output stutters on some audio cards. For instance kwyxz's SB
  128 with an es1371 chip.


Video output:

  * We don't render subtitles on RGB surfaces.

  * Subtitle colors are just plain wrong.

  * The DirectX video output plugin is broken because of vout4.

  * The BeOS video output plugin is broken because of vout4.

  * The QNX video output plugin is broken because of vout4.

  * The MGA video output plugin makes the picture stutter when MGA_NUM_FRAMES
    is set to a value higher than 1.

  * The SPU decoder doesn't detect when the video output failed to launch
    itself, and we segfault.

Chroma transformations:

  * The only working YUV2RGB transformation function is the MMX version
  of the 4:2:0 to RGB16 function.

  * Most chroma transformation modules completely ignore margins.

  * Most chroma transformation modules restrict the width of a picture
  to multiples of 8 or even 16. We can achieve better than that.


Filters:

  * Most filters completely ignore margins.


Gtk interface:

  * Playing like a madman with the `Playlist' button makes the interface
  crash.

  * Saving preferences does not work at all.


Misc:

  * The Jin-Roh DVD seems to segfault.
