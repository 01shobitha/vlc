Core:

  * vlc_cond_broadcast unimplemented on most plaforms.

  * --<moduletype> <module>:<args> doesn't work anymore.


Input:

  * There is a memory leak in the input because the input thread is
  never joined for termination.

  * vlc:foo targets don't work anymore.


Video output:

  * We don't render subtitles on RGB surfaces.

  * The DirectX video output plugin is broken because of vout4.

  * The GGI video output plugin is broken because of vout4.

  * The BeOS video output plugin is broken because of vout4.

Chroma transformations:

  * The only working YUV2RGB transformation function is the MMX version
  of the 4:2:0 to RGB16 function.

  * Most chroma transformation modules completely ignore margins.

  * Most chroma transformation modules restrict the width of a picture
  to multiples of 8 or even 16. We can achieve better than that.


Filters:

  * Most filters completely ignore margins.


Gtk interface:

  * Playing like a madman with the `Playlist' button makes the interface
  crash.

  * Saving preferences does not work at all.
